  abstract = {The unsustainable use of peatlands, mostly due to poor agricultural practices, has transformed many of the global peatland areas into carbon (C) sources and hotspots for greenhouse gas emissions. To mitigate such positive climate feedback, recent years have seen an increased interest in peatland restoration. An objective of peatland restoration programs is to monitor the spatiotemporal changes in the C-stock. Nevertheless, required information for peatland C-stock accounting such as the peat thickness (PT) is often lacking or available at lower than desired accuracy levels. While conventional methods for mapping PT are laborious and may be inaccurate, soil sensing techniques offer opportunities for more accurate and non-invasive mapping of soil properties. The present study aimed to assess the potency of three groups of sensory data obtained from a LiDAR-based digital elevation model (DEM), proximal electromagnetic induction (EMI) and gamma radiometric (GR) surveys, as covariates for the predictive mapping of PT of a 350-ha Danish bog. Seven multiple linear regression (MLR) and random forest (RF) models were built from the separate use of individual covariate groups, a combination of two groups and a combination of all three groups. The results indicated that models built with only proximally sensed EMI or GR covariates were the least accurate, especially for GR. Nevertheless, combining DEM and EMI covariates yielded the best prediction accuracy of PT for both MLR and RF models. For MLR, this resulted in an R2 and RMSE of 0.31 and 49.6 cm, and for RF, an R2 and RMSE of 0.61 and 37.3 cm. Overall, the present study demonstrates that for a bog with a long history of degradation induced by various land uses, covariates that characterize both surface and subsurface properties are essential for the predictive mapping of PT.},

  abstract = {Draining peatlands for agriculture transforms them into significant carbon (C) sources. Restoring drained peatlands is increasingly recognized as a climate action strategy to reduce terrestrial greenhouse gas emissions. Restoration efforts often require accurate inputs, like peat thickness (PT), for C-stock estimation and monitoring; however, these are often lacking or available at suboptimal accuracy levels. In this study, apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) from proximal electromagnetic induction (EMI) surveys and topographic variables derived from a LiDAR-based digital elevation model were assessed as covariates for PT mapping of an agricultural bog, separately and combined, using the quantile random forest algorithm. Local models were trained separately for the large (308~ha) and small (42~ha) EMI surveyed areas, while global models combined data from both areas for a full site analysis. The subsurface was characterized based on resistivity variations in inverted towed transient electromagnetic (tTEM) data. The results indicated that combining topographic and ECa covariates yielded the best PT prediction accuracy for the global model, with acoefficient of determination of 0.61 and a normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) of 0.10. The best large area local model was less accurate than the former (NRMSE of 0.18), while the best small area local model (NRMSE of 0.11) was superior to the best global model. Models trained with only topographic or ECa covariates were the least accurate, especially for the ECa-only model. The tTEM results revealed a heterogenous site characterized by a thin, resistive peat layer overlying stratified postglacial deposits of clay, sand, and saline chalk. Our findings show that covariates characterizing surface and subsurface properties are essential for accurate PT mapping and can inform tailored land use planning and restoration initiatives for degraded peatlands.},

  abstract = {Spatially extensive high-resolution soil moisture mapping is valuable in practical forestry and land management, but challenging. Here we present a novel technique involving use of LIDAR-derived terrain indices and machine learning (ML) algorithms capable of accurately modeling soil moisture at 2~m spatial resolution across the entire Swedish forest landscape. We used field data from about 20,000 sites across Sweden to train and evaluate multiple ML models. The predictor features (variables) included a suite of terrain indices generated from a national LIDAR digital elevation model and ancillary environmental features, including surficial geology, climate and land use, enabling adjustment of soil moisture class maps to regional or local conditions. Extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) provided better performance for a 2-class model, manifested by Cohen's Kappa and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) values of 0.69 and 0.68, respectively, than the other tested ML methods: Artificial Neural Network, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Na{\"i}ve Bayes classification. The depth to water index, topographic wetness index, and `wetland' categorization derived from Swedish property maps were the most important predictors for all models. The presented technique enabled generation of a 3-class model with Cohen's Kappa and MCC values of 0.58. In addition to the classified moisture maps, we investigated the technique's potential for producing continuous soil moisture maps. We argue that the probability of a pixel being classified as wet from a 2-class model can be used as a 0--100\% index (dry to wet) of soil moisture, and the resulting maps could provide more valuable information for practical forest management than classified maps.},

A shortcoming of black box supervised learning models (e.g. complex trees, neural networks, boosted trees, random forests, nearest neighbours, local kernel-weighted methods and support vector regression) in this regard is their lack of interpretability or transparency. Partial dependence plots, which are the most popular approach for visualizing the effects of the predictors with black box supervised learning models, can produce erroneous results if the predictors are strongly correlated, because they require extrapolation of the response at predictor values that are far outside the multivariate envelope of the training data. As an alternative to partial dependence plots, we present a new visualization approach that we term accumulated local effects plots, which do not require this unreliable extrapolation with correlated predictors. Moreover, accumulated local effects plots are far less computationally expensive than partial dependence plots. We also provide an R package ALEPlot as supplementary material to implement our proposed method.},

Evaluation consists of four steps: testing assumptions, testing data and methods, replicating outputs, and assessing outputs. Most principles for testing forecasting methods are based on commonly accepted methodological procedures, such as to prespecify criteria or to obtain a large sample of forecast errors. However, forecasters often violate such principles, even in academic studies. Some principles might be surprising, such as do not use R-square, do not use Mean Square Error, and do not use the within-sample fit of the model to select the most accurate time-series model.

The user community requires training in, and experience with, the new digital soil map products, especially about the use of uncertainties for risk modelling and policy development. Standards are required for public and private sector digital soil map products to prevent the production of poor-quality information which will become misleading and counter-productive. Machine-learning methods are to be used with caution with respect to their interpretability and parsimony.

The current wetland mapping techniques in Norway are tedious and costly, and remote sensing provides an opportunity for large-scale mapping and ecosystem accounting. We aimed to implement a deep learning approach to mapping wetlands with Sentinel-2 and LiDAR data over southern Norway. Our U-Net model, implemented through Google Earth Engine and TensorFlow, produced a wetland map with a balanced accuracy rate of 90.9\% when validated against an independent ground-truth sample. This represents an improvement upon manually digitized land cover maps in Norway, which achieved accuracy rates of 46.8\% (1:50,000 map) and 42.4\% (1:5000 map). Using our map, we estimated a total wetland coverage area of 12.7\% in southern Norway, which is double the previous benchmark estimates (5.6\%). We followed an iterative model training and evaluation approach, which revealed that increasing the quantity and coverage of labeled wetlands greatly increases the model performance. We highlight the potential of satellite-based wetland maps for the ecosystem accounting of changes in wetland extents over time---something that is not feasible with traditional mapping methods.},

The attenuation of the radiometric data identifies the main areas of water saturation in the very near surface. The radiometric data have the potential to identify additional areas where similar degrees of saturation exist. The data may therefore be used to help define extensions to existing site boundaries and to provide information in the assessment of new wetland areas. The radiometric data also show regional-scale transition from the Carboniferous Limestone in the east, important for water supply to the wetlands, to older more impermeable strata to the west. The conductivity data appear capable of mapping the lateral extent of clay accumulations, concealed below peat cover which can act as a confining layer to the bedrock aquifer. At the regional scale the data reveal the extent of a former Holocene lake system and the hydrogeological control of a Carboniferous limestone--sandstone contact. The data therefore provide a non-invasive spatially continuous, characterization of the sites, improving the understanding of their dynamic water balances and, potentially, guiding further ground assessments and invasive investigations.},

  abstract = {This study concerns the applied use of the natural radioactivity in soils. The relevance of airborne radiometric (gamma ray) survey data to peat mapping is now well established and such data have been used in a stand-alone sense and as covariates in machine learning algorithms. Here we present a method to use these data to accurately map the boundaries of peat (raised bogs). This has the potential to assist with the estimation of carbon stocks using a property-based assessment of soil. The significance of such regionally-uniform survey data lies in the subsurface information carried by the measurement which contrasts with the surficial nature of many other covariates. Soils attenuate radiometric flux by virtue of their bulk density (and associated carbon content) and water saturation level. The high attenuation levels in low density, wet peat materials give rise to a distinctive soil response. Here an entirely physics-based assessment of flux attenuation is carried out both theoretically and empirically. Radiometric data from the ongoing Tellus airborne survey of Ireland are used. The study area is characterised by an extensive assemblage of discrete raised peat bogs in a framework of largely mineral soils. Peat is detected by a property contrast with adjacent soils and so we consider all soils within the study area. The relatively low lateral resolution of the airborne data is demonstrated by modelling and we examine the behaviour of a combined spatial derivative of the data. The procedure allows the identification of the edges of the 128 peat polygons considered and indicates other additional potential areas of subsurface peat. The data appear to resolve the differences that exist across three available soil/peat databases that are used for the validation of the results obtained.},

  abstract = {The spatial resolution characteristics of airborne gamma-ray data are largely controlled by survey elevation and line separation. In the UK, although low nominal surveys altitudes may be permitted, regulatory zones with elevations in excess of 180m are required above conurbations. Since the data, typically in the form of grids, are evaluated alongside many other detailed geoscientific spatial datasets their absolute resolution limits, together with their spatial characteristics, become relevant. Here, using published software, we study the theoretical resolution characteristics of this form of survey data obtained with a line separation of 200m. Of particular interest is the airborne response behaviour when non-uniform distributions of radioactivity are encountered. Although ultimately a function of the radioelement-concentration contrast encountered, the calculations reveal that such zones are most difficult to identify when their scale length decreases below the scale of the line separation. This limited resolution then further decreases with elevation. In order to increase our ability to resolve the edges of non-uniform source regions we calculate the horizontal gradient magnitude (HGM) of the observed data. While the data used can be the estimated radioelement concentrations (potassium, thorium and uranium) or their ratios, we demonstrate that the total count is particularly suited to this type of analysis. The theoretical calculations are supported by an examination of survey data across a series of isolated bodies (offshore islands). This empirical study indicates the practical limits to resolution when using the horizontal gradient and these are governed by the survey line separation. The HGM response provides an enhanced mapping of the edges of zones associated with a contrast in flux behaviour. The edges are detected using the maxima in the response and these can be additionally examined using grid curvature analysis. The technique is assessed using recent survey data containing geological, soil and environmental influences. The results demonstrate the spatially pervasive nature of flux contrasts associated with soil and environmental contributions which potentially mask, or perturb, the underlying bedrock geological response.},

  abstract = {This study considers UK airborne gamma-ray data obtained through a series of high spatial resolution, low altitude surveys over the past decade. The ground concentrations of the naturally occurring radionuclides Potassium, Thorium and Uranium are converted to air absorbed dose rates and these are used to assess terrestrial exposure levels from both natural and technologically enhanced sources. The high resolution airborne information is also assessed alongside existing knowledge from soil sampling and ground-based measurements of exposure levels. The surveys have sampled an extensive number of the UK lithological bedrock formations and the statistical information provides examples of low dose rate lithologies (the formations that characterise much of southern England) to the highest sustained values associated with granitic terrains. The maximum dose rates (e.g. {$>$}300~nGy~h-1) encountered across the sampled granitic terrains are found to vary by a factor of 2. Excluding granitic terrains, the most spatially extensive dose rates ({$>$}50~nGy~h-1) are found in association with the Mercia Mudstone Group (Triassic argillaceous mudstones) of eastern England. Geological associations between high dose rate and high radon values are also noted. Recent studies of the datasets have revealed the extent of source rock (i.e. bedrock) flux attenuation by soil moisture in conjunction with the density and porosity of the temperate latitude soils found in the UK. The presence or absence of soil cover (and associated presence or absence of attenuation) appears to account for a range of localised variations in the exposure levels encountered. The hypothesis is supported by a study of an extensive combined data set of dose rates obtained from soil sampling and by airborne geophysical survey. With no attenuation factors applied, except those intrinsic to the airborne estimates, a bias to high values of between 10 and 15~nGy~h-1 is observed in the soil data. A wide range of technologically enhanced, localised contributions to dose rate values are also apparent in the data sets. Two detailed examples are provided that reveal the detectability of site-scale environmental impacts due to former industrial activities and the high dose values ({$>$}500~nGy~h-1) that are associated with former, small-scale Uranium mining operations.},

  abstract = {This study considers gamma ray attenuation in relation to the soils and bedrock of Northern Ireland using simple theory and data from a high resolution airborne survey. The bedrock is considered as a source of radiogenic material acting as parent to the soil. Attenuation in the near-surface is then controlled by water content in conjunction with the porosity and density of the soil cover. The Total Count radiometric data together with 1:250~k mapping of the soils and bedrock of Northern Ireland are used to perform statistical analyses emphasising the nature of the low count behaviour. Estimations of the bedrock response characteristics are improved by excluding areas covered by low count soils (organic/humic). Equally, estimations of soil response characteristics are improved by excluding areas underlain by low count bedrock (basalt). When the spatial characteristics of the soil-classified data are examined in detail, the low values form spatially-coherent zones (natural clusters) that can potentially be interpreted as areas of increased water content for each soil type. As predicted by theory, the highest attenuation factors are associated with the three organic soil types studied here. Peat, in particular, is remarkably skewed to low count behaviour in its radiometric response. Two detailed studies of blanket bogs reveal the extent to which peat may be mapped by its radiometric response while the intra-peat variations in the observed response may indicate areas of thin cover together with areas of increased water content.},

  abstract = {This study considers recent airborne radiometric (gamma ray) survey data, obtained at high-resolution, across various regions of the UK. The datasets all display a very evident attenuation of signal in association with peat, and intra-peat variations are observed. The geophysical response variations are examined in detail using example data sets across lowland areas (raised bogs, meres, fens and afforested peat) and upland areas of blanket bog, together with associated wetland zones. The radiometric data do not map soils per se. The bedrock (the radiogenic parent) provides a specific amplitude level. Attenuation of this signal level is then controlled by moisture content in conjunction with the density and porosity of the soil cover. Both soil and bedrock variations need to be jointly assessed. The attenuation theory, reviewed here, predicts that the behaviour of wet peat is distinct from most other soil types. Theory also predicts that the attenuation levels observed across wet peatlands cannot be generally used to map variations in peat thickness. Four survey areas at various scales, across England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland are used to demonstrate the ability of the airborne data to map peat zones. A 1:50 k national mapping of deep peat is used to provide control although variability in the definition of peat zones across existing databases is also demonstrated.},

  abstract = {Soil studies using radiometric data typically employ one or more of the main, naturally occurring radioelement estimates (potassium, thorium and uranium) to undertake a variety of soil property assessments. This study concerns an attenuation assessment of high-resolution radiometric data obtained by a recent airborne geophysical survey in SW England. These data provide continuous measurements over a wide-range of region-specific soils and their parent bedrock materials. A prime motivation for this study is the observed complexity of the spatial variance in the radiometric signal level. Although such data may be jointly classified according to soil and bedrock types, variable attenuation levels in the signal levels remain to be explained. The data appear to carry information on soil properties additional to that of texture or other available soil descriptors. Existing gamma-ray theory indicates that the attenuation behaviour of radiometric data is jointly controlled by soil density and wetness in the upper {\textasciitilde}60cm of the soil profile. Low density, highly organic soils (e.g. peat) produce readily identifiable and variable attenuation zones. All soil types are predicted to attenuate radiometric signal levels but at lower density--wetness sensitivities. The broad radiometric response level is, as expected, found to be controlled by bedrock. Clay mineral soils provide the most uniform response behaviour with respect to bedrock type. Peat soils display the lowest amplitude and most variable signal levels. The data from similar bedrock formations, even with the same lithological descriptor (e.g. argillaceous), can display distinctly different geostatistical behaviour when the same soil type is considered. A variety of inferred attenuation zones are discussed in relation to supporting information on soil property and soil and land-use classifications. Spatial inconsistencies in existing database descriptors of organic rich zones are demonstrated and it is evident that the radiometric data can assist in resolving such ambiguities. The supporting control information has been found to be often ambiguous or unavailable at a scale appropriate to the field-of-view of the airborne measurements. Within this wider context, it is suggested that an observational database, such as that supplied by the radiometric data, may assist in providing enhanced spatial assessments of the soils and soil properties encountered},

  abstract = {Digital soil mapping (DSM) involves the use of georeferenced information and statistical models to map predictions and uncertainties related to soil properties. Many remote regions of the globe, such as boreal forest ecosystems, are characterized by low sampling efforts and limited availability of field soil data. Although DSM is an expanding topic in soil science, little guidance currently exists to select the appropriate combination of statistical methods and model formulation in the context of limited data availability. Using the Canadian managed forest as a case study, the main objective of this study was to investigate to which extent the choice of statistical method and model specification could improve the spatial prediction of soil properties with limited data. More specifically, we compared the cross-product performance of eight statistical approaches (linear, additive and geostatistical models, and four machine-learning techniques) and three model formulations (``covariates only'': a suite of environmental covariates only; ``spatial only'': a function of geographic coordinates only; and ``covariates+spatial'': a combination of both covariates and spatial functions) to predict five key forest soil properties in the organic layer (thickness and C:N ratio) and in the top 15cm of the mineral horizon (carbon concentration, percentage of sand, and bulk density). Our results show that 1) although strong differences in predictive performance occurred across all statistical approaches and model formulations, spatially explicit models consistently had higher R2 and lower RMSE values than non-spatial models for all soil properties, except for the C:N ratio; 2) Bayesian geostatistical models were among the best methods, followed by ordinary kriging and machine-learning methods; and 3) comparative analyses made it possible to identify the more performant models and statistical methods to predict specific soil properties. We make modeling tools and code available (e.g., Bayesian geostastical models) that increase DSM capabilities and support existing efforts toward the production of improved digital soil products with limited data.},

  abstract = {The organic carbon (C) stocks contained in peat were estimated for a wetland-rich boreal region of the Mackenzie River Basin, Canada, using high-resolution wetland map data, available peat C characteristic and peat depth datasets, and geostatistics. Peatlands cover 32\% of the 25 119 km2 study area, and consist mainly of surface- and/or groundwater-fed treed peatlands. The thickness of peat deposits measured at 203 sites was 2.5 m on average but as deep as 6 m, and highly variable between sites. Peat depths showed little relationship with terrain data within 1 and 5 km, but were spatially autocorrelated, and were generalized using ordinary kriging. Polygon-scale calculations and Monte Carlo simulations yielded a total peat C stock of 982--1025 {\texttimes} 1012 g C that varied in C mass per unit area between 53 and 165 kg m-2. This geostatistical approach showed as much as 10\% more peat C than calculations using mean depths. We compared this estimate with an overlapping 7868 km2 portion of an independent peat C stock estimate for western Canada, which revealed similar values for total peatland area, total C stock, and total peat C mass per unit area. However, agreement was poor within {$\sim$}875 km2 grids owing to inconsistencies in peatland cover and little relationship in peat depth between estimates. The greatest disagreement in mean peat C mass per unit area occurred in grids with the largest peatland cover, owing to the spatial coincidence of large cover and deep peat in our high-resolution assessment. We conclude that total peat C stock estimates in the southern Mackenzie Basin and perhaps in boreal western Canada are likely of reasonable accuracy. However, owing to uncertainties particularly in peat depth, the quality of information regarding the location of these large stocks at scales as wide as several hundreds of square kilometers is presently much more limited.},

  abstract = {A hydrological forecasting model is presented that attempts to combine the important distributed effects of channel network topology and dynamic contributing areas with the advantages of simple lumped parameter basin models. Quick response flow is predicted from a storage/contributing area relationship derived analytically from the topographic structure of a unit within a basin. Average soil water response is represented by a constant leakage infiltration store and an exponential subsurface water store. A simple non-linear routing procedure related to the link frequency distribution of the channel network completes the model and allows distinct basin sub-units, such as headwater and sideslope areas to be modelled separately. The model parameters are physically based in the sense that they may be determined directly by measurement and the model may be used at ungauged sites. Procedures for applying the model and tests with data from the Crimple Beck basin are described. Using only measured and estimated parameter values, without optimization, the model makes satisfactory predictions of basin response. The modular form of the model structure should allow application over a range of small and medium sized basins while retaining the possibility of including more complex model components when suitable data are available.},

Prior to this work, DSM products had yet to definitively outperform CSM products, except in locations where existing CSM maps were based on low investment (e.g., generalized national soil maps). While DSM has had established advantages, such as quantitative property prediction and cost efficiency, remaining challenges for widespread adoption include obtaining accuracy and practicality that exceed CSM-based maps in areas with histories of strong soil survey programs. In comparison with SSURGO, multiple top-down DSM products (SoilGrids 2.0, POLARIS, and Soil Properties and Class 100~m Grids of the USA) were evaluated along with the locally enhanced DSM product called LE-DSM (locally enhanced digital soil map). These maps were compared for their predictions of clay, silt, sand, and organic matter content at standard depth intervals to 200~cm. SSURGO outperformed the national and global top-down DSM products for 75~\% of the soil properties and depths. In contrast, LE-DSM demonstrated appreciably higher accuracy than SSURGO 46~\% of the time. These results indicate that bottom-up DSM products are needed for superseding the accuracy of CSM products, which themselves are constructed from a locally enhanced bottom-up approach.},

  abstract = {Deep learning is driving recent advances behind many everyday technologies, including speech and image recognition, natural language processing and autonomous driving. It is also gaining popularity in biology, where it has been used for automated species identification, environmental monitoring, ecological modelling, behavioural studies, DNA sequencing and population genetics and phylogenetics, among other applications. Deep learning relies on artificial neural networks for predictive modelling and excels at recognizing complex patterns. In this review we synthesize 818 studies using deep learning in the context of ecology and evolution to give a discipline-wide perspective necessary to promote a rethinking of inference approaches in the field. We provide an introduction to machine learning and contrast it with mechanistic inference, followed by a gentle primer on deep learning. We review the applications of deep learning in ecology and evolution and discuss its limitations and efforts to overcome them. We also provide a practical primer for biologists interested in including deep learning in their toolkit and identify its possible future applications. We find that deep learning is being rapidly adopted in ecology and evolution, with 589 studies (64\%) published since the beginning of 2019. Most use convolutional neural networks (496 studies) and supervised learning for image identification but also for tasks using molecular data, sounds, environmental data or video as input. More sophisticated uses of deep learning in biology are also beginning to appear. Operating within the machine learning paradigm, deep learning can be viewed as an alternative to mechanistic modelling. It has desirable properties of good performance and scaling with increasing complexity, while posing unique challenges such as sensitivity to bias in input data. We expect that rapid adoption of deep learning in ecology and evolution will continue, especially in automation of biodiversity monitoring and discovery and inference from genetic data. Increased use of unsupervised learning for discovery and visualization of clusters and gaps, simplification of multi-step analysis pipelines, and integration of machine learning into graduate and postgraduate training are all likely in the near future.},

Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting.

  abstract = {In the past decade, substantial progress has been made in model-based optimization of sampling designs for mapping. This paper is an update of the overview of sampling designs for mapping presented by de Gruijter et al. (2006). For model-based estimation of values at unobserved points (mapping), probability sampling is not required, which opens up the possibility of optimized non-probability sampling. Non-probability sampling designs for mapping are regular grid sampling, spatial coverage sampling, k-means sampling, conditioned Latin hypercube sampling, response surface sampling, Kennard-Stone sampling and model-based sampling. In model-based sampling a preliminary model of the spatial variation of the soil variable of interest is used for optimizing the sample size and or the spatial coordinates of the sampling locations. Kriging requires knowledge of the variogram. Sampling designs for variogram estimation are nested sampling, independent random sampling of pairs of points, and model-based designs in which either the uncertainty about the variogram parameters, or the uncertainty about the kriging variance is minimized. Various minimization criteria have been proposed for designing a single sample that is suitable both for estimating the variogram and for mapping. For map validation, additional probability sampling is recommended, so that unbiased estimates of map quality indices and their standard errors can be obtained. For all sampling designs, R scripts are available in the supplement. Further research is recommended on sampling designs for mapping with machine learning techniques, designs that are robust against deviations of modeling assumptions, designs tailored at mapping multiple soil variables of interest and soil classes or fuzzy memberships, and probability sampling designs that are efficient both for design-based estimation of populations means and for model-based mapping.},

  abstract = {The Norwegian area frame survey of land cover and outfield land resources (AR18X18), completed in 2014, provided unbiased statistics of land cover in Norway. The article reports the new statistics, discusses implications of the data set, and provides potential value in terms of research, management, and monitoring. A gridded sampling design for 1081 primary statistical units of 0.9 km2 at 18 km intervals was implemented in the survey. The plots were mapped in situ, aided by aerial photos, and all areas were coded following a vegetation type system. The results provide new insights into the cover and distribution of vegetation and land cover types. The statistic for mire and wetlands, which previously covered 5.8\%, has since been corrected to 8.9\%. The survey results can be used for environmental and agricultural management, and the data can be stratified for regional analyses. The survey data can also serve as training data for remote sensing and distribution modelling. Finally, the survey data can be used to calibrate vegetation perturbations in climate change research that focuses on atmospheric--vegetation feedback. The survey documented novel land cover statistics and revealed that the national cover of wetlands had previously been underestimated.},

To assess peat C in the Northern Highlands Lake District (NHLD), a {$\sim$}7000 km2 region in northern Wisconsin, United States, with 20\% peatland by area, we sampled 21 peatlands. In each peatland, peat depth (including basal organic lake sediment, where present) was measured on a grid and interpolated to calculate mean depth. Our study addressed three questions: (1) How spatially variable is peat depth? (2) To what degree can mean peat depth be predicted from other field measurements (water chemistry, water table depth, vegetation cover, slope) and/or remotely sensed spatial data? (3) How much C is stored in NHLD peatlands? Site mean peat depth ranged from 0.1 to 5.1 m. Most of the peatlands had been formed by the in-filling of small lake basins (terrestrialization), and depths up to 15 m were observed. Mean peat depth for small peat basins could be best predicted from basin edge slope at the peatland/upland interface, either measured in the field or calculated from digital elevation (DEM) data (Adj. R2 = 0.70). Upscaling using the DEM-based regression gave a regional mean peat depth of 2.1 {\textpm} 0.2 m (including {$\sim$}0.1--0.4 m of organic lake sediment) and 144 {\textpm} 21 Tg-C in total. As DEM data are widely available, this technique has the potential to improve C storage estimates in regions with peatlands formed primarily by terrestrialization.},

This study offers a new method to create an accurate peat depth map while reducing field drilling data up to 75\%. Ordinary least square (OLS) adjustments were used to estimate the elevation of the mineral soil surface based on the surrounding soil parameters. Orthophoto and Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) from LiDAR data of Tebing Tinggi Island, Riau, were used to determine morphology, topography, and spatial position parameters to define the DTM and its coefficients. Peat depth prediction models involving 100\%, 50\%, and 25\% of the field points were developed using the OLS computations, and compared against the field survey data. Raster operations in a GIS were used in processing the DTM, to produce peat depth estimations. The results show that the soil map produced from OLS provided peat depth estimations with no significant difference from the field depth data at a mean absolute error of {\textpm}1 meter. The use of LiDAR data and the OLS method provides a cost-effective methodology for estimating peat depth and mapping for the purpose of supporting peat restoration.},

Two of 27 parameters measured at one site and 10 of 14 parameters measured at the second site were normally distributed. Spatial variability was investigated using semivariograms and the ratio of nugget to total semivariance, expressed as a percentage, was used to classify spatial dependence. A ratio of {$<$}25\% indicated strong spatial dependence, between 25 and 75\% indicated moderate spatial dependence, and {$>$}75\% indicated weak spatial dependence. Twelve parameters at Site one, including organic C, total N, pH, and macroaggregation, and four parameters at Site two, including organic C and total N, were strongly spatially dependent. Six parameters at Site one, including biomass C and N, bulk density, and denitrification, and 9 parameters at Site two, including biomass C and N and bulk density, were moderately spatially dependent. Three parameters at Site one, including NO-3 N and ergosterol, and one parameter at Site two, mineral-associated N, were weakly spatially dependent. Distributions of exchangeable Ca and Mg at Site one were not spatially dependent. Spatial distributions for some soil properties were similar for both field sites. We will be able to exploit these similarities to improve our ability to extrapolate information taken from one field to other fields within similar landscapes.},

  abstract = {Soil is one of the most complex systems on Earth, functioning at the interface between the lithosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere and generating a multitude of functions. Moreover, soil constitutes the belowground environment from which plants capture water and nutrients. Despite their great importance, soil properties are often not sufficiently considered in other disciplines, especially in spatial studies of plant distributions. Most soil properties are available as point data and, to be used in spatial analyses, need to be generalised over entire regions (i.e. digital soil mapping). Three categories of statistical approaches can be used for such purpose: geostatistical approaches (GSA), predictive-statistical approaches (PSA), and hybrid approaches (HA) that combine the two previous ones. How then to choose the best approach in a given soil study context? Does it depend on the soil properties to be spatialized, the study area's characteristics, and/or the availability of soil data? The main aims of this study was to review the use of these three approaches to derive maps of soil properties in relation to the soil parameters, the study area characteristics, and the number of soil samples. We evidenced that the approaches that tend to show the best performance for spatializing soil properties were not necessarily the ones most used in practice. Although PSA was the most widely used, it tended to be outperformed by HA in many cases, but the latter was far less used. However, as the study settings were not always properly described and not all situations were represented in the set of papers analysed, more comparative studies would be needed across a wider range of regions, soil properties, and spatial scales to provide robust conclusions on the best spatialization methods in a specific context.},

  abstract = {1 Raised bogs of the boreal and temperate zone typically show surface patterning on two distinct organizational levels. A conspicuous pattern of alternating dry strings and wet flarks aligned perpendicular to the slope occurs in combination with other microtopes, resulting in a mesotope pattern. 2 Patterning on both these levels can be explained by a simple, spatially explicit model that assumes predominantly lateral water flow through an acrotelm that is draped over a dome-shaped catotelm. The model distinguishes two types of surface elements: hum-mocks with low transmissivity growing under dry conditions and hollows with high transmissivity growing under wet conditions. 3 Hummocks dam up water and stimulate the development of hollows upslope, whereas hollows effectively drain upslope areas, stimulating the development of hummocks. If the dome is steep and the recharge high enough, this leads to the development of a string-flark microtope. 4 Four distinct types of microtopes are distinguished: (i) areas entirely covered by hummocks, (ii) randomly arranged hummocks and hollows, (iii) string-flark striping patterns and (iv) areas entirely covered by hollows. 5 Different combinations of sharply delineated microtopes occur with different parameter settings, allowing for the classification of four types of raised bog mesotopes. In addition to such qualitative differences, the extent and composition of the microtopes vary with parameter settings, reflecting the variety observed in natural systems. 6 Our simple simulation model shows how small-scale, local processes can create a variety of large and complex landscape patterns. These patterns can be used to describe raised bogs in terms of biological entities of a higher organizational order (ecosystem biodiversity), typically recognizable in often species-poor peatland ecosystems.},

They provide variable importance measures to rank predictors according to their predictive power. If building a prediction model is the main goal of a study, often a minimal set of variables with good prediction performance is selected. However, if the objective is the identification of involved variables to find active networks and pathways, approaches that aim to select all relevant variables should be preferred. We evaluated several variable selection procedures based on simulated data as well as publicly available experimental methylation and gene expression data. Our comparison included the Boruta algorithm, the Vita method, recurrent relative variable importance, a permutation approach and its parametric variant (Altmann) as well as recursive feature elimination (RFE).{$\quad$}In our simulation studies, Boruta was the most powerful approach, followed closely by the Vita method. Both approaches demonstrated similar stability in variable selection, while Vita was the most robust approach under a pure null model without any predictor variables related to the outcome. In the analysis of the different experimental data sets, Vita demonstrated slightly better stability in variable selection and was less computationally intensive than Boruta.In conclusion, we recommend the Boruta and Vita approaches for the analysis of high-dimensional data sets. Vita is considerably faster than Boruta and thus more suitable for large data sets, but only Boruta can also be applied in low-dimensional settings.},

  abstract = {IntroductionThe increased adoption of proximal sensors has helped to generate peat mapping products: they gather data quickly and can detect the peat-mineral later boundary. A third layer, made of sedimentary peat (limnic layers, gyttja), can sometimes be found in between them. This material is highly variable spatially and is associated with degraded soil properties when located near the surface.MethodsThis study aimed to assess the potential of direct current resistivity measurements to predict the maximum peat thickness (MPT), defined as the non-limnic peat thickness, to facilitate soil conservation and management practices at the field-scale. The results were also compared to a regional map of the MPT from a previous study used and also tested as a covariate. This study was conducted in a shallow (MPT = 8-138~cm) cultivated organic soil from Qu{\'e}bec, Canada. The MPT was mapped using the apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) from a Veris Q2800, and a digital elevation model, with and without a regional MPT map (RM) as a covariate to downscale it. Three machine-learning algorithms (Cubist, Random Forest, and Support Vector Regression) were compared to ordinary kriging (OK), multiple linear regression, and multiple linear regression kriging (MLRK) models.Results and discussionThe best predictive performance was achieved with OK (Lin's CCC = 0.89, RMSE = 13.75~cm), followed by MLRK-RM (CCC = 0.85, RMSE~=~15.7~cm). All models were more accurate than the RM (CCC = 0.65, RMSE = 29.85~cm), although they underpredicted MPT {$>$} 100~cm. Moreover, the addition of the RM as a covariate led to a lower prediction error and higher accuracy for all models. Overall, a field-scale approach could better support precision soil conservation interventions by generating more accurate management zones. Future studies should test multi-sensor fusion and other geophysical sensors to further improve the model performance and detect deeper boundaries.},

  abstract = {Large organic deposits in the southwestern plain of Montreal have been converted to agricultural land for vegetable production. In addition to the variable depth of the organic deposits, these soils commonly have an impermeable coprogenous layer between the peat and the underlying mineral substratum. Estimations of the depth and thickness of these materials are critical for soil management. Therefore, five drained and cultivated peatlands were studied to estimate their maximum peat thickness (MPT)---a potential key soil property that can help identify management zones for their conservation. MPT can be defined as the depth to the mineral layer (DML) minus the coprogenous layer thickness (CLT). The objective of this study was to estimate DML, CLT, and MPT at a regional scale using environmental covariates derived from remote sensing. Three machine-learning models (Cubist, Random Forest, and k-Nearest Neighbor) were compared to produce maps of DML and CLT, which were combined to generate MPT at a spatial resolution of 10~m. The Cubist model performed the best for predicting both features of interest, yielding Lin's concordance correlation coefficients of 0.43 and 0.07 for DML and CLT, respectively, using a spatial cross-validation procedure. Interpretation of the drivers of CLT was limited by the poor predictive power of the final model. More precise data on MPT are needed to support soil conservation practices, and more CLT field observations are required to obtain a higher prediction accuracy. Nonetheless, digital soil mapping using open-access geospatial data shows promise for understanding and managing cultivated peatlands.},

  abstract = {Sampling for Digital Soil Mapping is an expensive and time-constrained operation. It is crucial to consider these limitations in practical situations, particularly when dealing with large-scale areas that are remote and poorly accessible. To address this issue, several authors have proposed methods based on cost constraints optimization to reduce the travel time between sampling sites. These methods focused on optimizing the access cost associated to each sample site, but have not explicitly addressed field work time required for the whole sampling campaign. Hence, an estimation of fieldwork time is of great interest to assists soil surveyors in efficiently planning and executing optimized field surveys. The goal of this study is to propose, implement and test a new method named Multi-Objective Operational Sampling (MOOS), to minimize sampling route time, while ensuring that sample representativeness of the area is maintained. It offers multiple optimal sampling designs, allowing practitioners to select the most suitable option based on their desired sample quality and available time resources. The proposed sampling method is derived from conditioned Latin Hypercube sampling (cLHS) that optimizes both total field work time (travel time and on-site sampling time) and sample representativeness of the study area (cLHS objective function). The use of a multi-objective optimization algorithm (NSGA II) provides a variety of optimal sampling designs with varying sample size. The sampling route time computation is based on an access cost map derived from remote sensing images and expert annotation data. A least-cost algorithm is used to create a time matrix allowing precise evaluation of the time required to connect each pair of sites and thus determine an optimal path. The proposed method has been implemented and tested on sampling for pHH2O mapping within a 651 points kilometric grid in the northern part of Saudi Arabia, where soil analyses were conducted over a 1,069~km2 area. MOOS method was compared to two other common approaches: classical cLHS and cLHS incorporating access cost. The performance of each method was assessed with the cross-validated RMSE and sampling route time in days. Results show that the MOOS method outperforms the two others in terms of sampling route time, especially with increasing sample size, gaining up to 1~day of work for the presented case study. It still ensures a relevant map accuracy and sample representativeness when compared to the two methods. This approach yields promising outcomes for field sampling in digital soil mapping. By simultaneously optimizing both sample representativeness and cost constraints, it holds potential as a valuable decision support tool for soil surveyors facing sampling designs in poorly accessible areas.},

Selecting an appropriate approach for building an XAI-enabled application requires a clear understanding of the core ideas within XAI and the associated programming frameworks. We survey state-of-the-art programming techniques for XAI and present the different phases of XAI in a typical machine learning development process. We classify the various XAI approaches and, using this taxonomy, discuss the key differences among the existing XAI techniques. Furthermore, concrete examples are used to describe these techniques that are mapped to programming frameworks and software toolkits. It is the intention that this survey will help stakeholders in selecting the appropriate approaches, programming frameworks, and software toolkits by comparing them through the lens of the presented taxonomy.},

  abstract = {The effective use of environmental covariates in characterizing soil--environment relationships is key to successful digital soil mapping. The typical way to use environmental covariates in digital soil mapping is by selecting diverse environmental covariates considering the overall geographical characteristics of the study area and considering these covariates to have consistent applicability across the whole area. However, this practice ignores the fact that the applicability of each environmental covariate in characterizing soil--environment relationships varies over complex environmental conditions, especially in large areas. This study proposed a method to adaptively consider covariate applicability in large-area digital soil mapping using soil--environment relationships. The applicability of each covariate at each location was quantified from the terrain conditions using the newly designed fuzzy functions in the study. Then the covariate applicability was regarded as the importance weight and integrated into an existing representative method, iPSM (individual predictive soil mapping). The integration was separately performed at the similarity calculation and soil estimation stages of iPSM to generate two new methods: iPSM weighting on the applicability of all covariates (iPSM\_WCovar\_all), and iPSM weighting on the applicability of the limiting covariate (i.e., the covariate with the minimum similarity between two locations that constrains the overall similarity) (iPSM\_WCovar\_limit). Experiments were carried in Anhui Province, China. The two new methods were used to predict the soil organic matter content of topsoil and outperformed the original iPSM and random forest kriging methods. The root mean square error of the iPSM\_WCovar\_all, iPSM\_WCovar\_limit, iPSM and random forest kriging methods were 8.14, 8.00, 8.88 and 9.65~g/kg, respectively, while the mean absolute error of those methods were 6.48, 6.31, 6.61 and 6.82~g/kg. Both proposed methods outperformed the iPSM method and the other commonly used method, i.e., random forest kriging. Moreover, the performance was stable under different parameter settings. Experimental results indicate that the idea of adaptively considering covariate applicability in digital soil mapping is feasible and effective.},

  abstract = {Tropical peatlands store a large amount of carbon and act as carbon sinks, thus have crucial roles in regulating climate by preventing CO2 emission and enhancing carbon sequestration. However, the conversion of these peatlands for agricultural purposes, such as oil palm plantations, leads to carbon loss and increased CO2 emissions. To effectively protect and manage vulnerable areas, accurate mapping of peatland thickness and carbon stocks is essential, aligning with Indonesia's National Determined Contribution to climate action. This research article aims to assess the status of peatland in Agam-West Pasaman, Western Sumatra, which was cleared between 1990 and 2000 for oil palm cultivation. Digital Soil Mapping (DSM) approaches were employed to map peat thickness, carbon stock and estimate carbon loss resulting from land use change. The study area, spanning 54,000 hectares, was covered by peat-swamp forest in 1989. A grid of 2 km was used for a soil survey, resulting in 134 observation points of peat thickness, water level and subsidence. Various spatial prediction methods, including geostatistics, machine learning (ML) and their combination, were tested to map peat thickness, carbon stocks, subsidence rate and carbon loss. The covariates considered in the analysis were elevation, nearest distance from rivers and Sentinel 1a radar images. The results obtained through 10-fold cross-validations revealed that ordinary kriging exhibited the best performance, with an R2 of 0.44 for peat thickness and 0.39 for carbon stocks. The superior performance of ordinary kriging can be attributed to the severe impact of human activities in the area, which disrupted the clear relationship between peat parameters and environmental covariates. The estimated carbon stock of the area was 107 Mt C (std. dev. 0.143 Mt), while the carbon loss since the establishment of oil palm plantations was estimated to be 19.50 Mt C (std. dev. 0.017 Mt C) based on subsidence data. These findings provide insights into the degradation of the peatland and the magnitude of carbon loss over the past three decades. This information supports informed decision-making and contributes to efforts aimed at preserving and restoring peatlands.},

This study uses linear mixed models (LMMs) to test how topographic (elevation, slope, aspect) and superficial geology parameters can contribute to improved depth estimates across a Scottish upland catchment. Mean (n = 5) depth data from 283 sites (representing full covariate ranges) were used to calibrate LMMs, which were tested against a validation dataset. Models were estimated using maximum likelihood, and the Akaike Information Criterion was used to test whether the iterative addition of covariates to a model with constant fixed effects was beneficial. Elevation, slope and certain geology classes were all identified as useful covariates. Upon addition of the random effects (i.e. spatial modelling of residuals), the RMSE for the model with constant-only fixed effects reduced by 24\%. Addition of random effects to a model with topographic covariates (fixed effects = constant, slope, elevation) reduced the RMSE by 13\%, whereas the addition of random effects to a model with topographic and geological covariates (fixed effects = constant, slope, elevation, certain geology classes) reduced the RMSE by only 3\%. Therefore, much of the spatial pattern in depth was explained by the fixed effects in the latter model. The study contributes to a growing research base demonstrating that widely available topographic (and also here geological) datasets, which have national coverage, can be included in spatial models to improve organic horizon depth estimations.},

  abstract = {Accurate assessment of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and their redistribution among the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere in a changing climate -- the ``global carbon budget'' -- is important to better understand the global carbon cycle, support the development of climate policies, and project future climate change. Here we describe and synthesize data sets and methodology to quantify the five major components of the global carbon budget and their uncertainties. Fossil CO2 emissions (EFOS) are based on energy statistics and cement production data, while emissions from land-use change (ELUC), mainly deforestation, are based on land use and land-use change data and bookkeeping models. Atmospheric CO2 concentration is measured directly and its growth rate (GATM) is computed from the annual changes in concentration. The ocean CO2 sink (SOCEAN) and terrestrial CO2 sink (SLAND) are estimated with global process models constrained by observations. The resulting carbon budget imbalance (BIM), the difference between the estimated total emissions and the estimated changes in the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere, is a measure of imperfect data and understanding of the contemporary carbon cycle. All uncertainties are reported as {\textpm}1{$\sigma$}. For the last decade available (2010--2019), EFOS was 9.6\&thinsp;{\textpm}\&thinsp;0.5\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr-1 excluding the cement carbonation sink (9.4\&thinsp;{\textpm}\&thinsp;0.5\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr-1 when the cement carbonation sink is included), and ELUC was 1.6\&thinsp;{\textpm}\&thinsp;0.7\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr-1. For the same decade, GATM was 5.1\&thinsp;{\textpm}\&thinsp;0.02\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr-1 (2.4\&thinsp;{\textpm}\&thinsp;0.01\&thinsp;ppm\&thinsp;yr-1), SOCEAN 2.5\&thinsp;{\textpm}\&thinsp; 0.6\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr-1, and SLAND 3.4\&thinsp;{\textpm}\&thinsp;0.9\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr-1, with a budget imbalance BIM of -0.1\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr-1 indicating a near balance between estimated sources and sinks over the last decade. For the year 2019 alone, the growth in EFOS was only about 0.1\&thinsp;\% with fossil emissions increasing to 9.9\&thinsp;{\textpm}\&thinsp;0.5\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr-1 excluding the cement carbonation sink (9.7\&thinsp;{\textpm}\&thinsp;0.5\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr-1 when cement carbonation sink is included), and ELUC was 1.8\&thinsp;{\textpm}\&thinsp;0.7\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr-1, for total anthropogenic CO2 emissions of 11.5\&thinsp;{\textpm}\&thinsp;0.9\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr-1 (42.2\&thinsp;{\textpm}\&thinsp;3.3\&thinsp;GtCO2). Also for 2019, GATM was 5.4\&thinsp;{\textpm}\&thinsp;0.2\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr-1 (2.5\&thinsp;{\textpm}\&thinsp;0.1\&thinsp;ppm\&thinsp;yr-1), SOCEAN was 2.6\&thinsp;{\textpm}\&thinsp;0.6\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr-1, and SLAND was 3.1\&thinsp;{\textpm}\&thinsp;1.2\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr-1, with a BIM of 0.3\&thinsp;GtC. The global atmospheric CO2 concentration reached 409.85\&thinsp;{\textpm}\&thinsp;0.1\&thinsp;ppm averaged over 2019. Preliminary data for 2020, accounting for the COVID-19-induced changes in emissions, suggest a decrease in EFOS relative to 2019 of about -7\&thinsp;\% (median estimate) based on individual estimates from four studies of -6\&thinsp;\%, -7\&thinsp;\%, -7\&thinsp;\% (-3\&thinsp;\% to -11\&thinsp;\%), and -13\&thinsp;\%. Overall, the mean and trend in the components of the global carbon budget are consistently estimated over the period 1959--2019, but discrepancies of up to 1\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr-1 persist for the representation of semi-decadal variability in CO2 fluxes. Comparison of estimates from diverse approaches and observations shows (1) no consensus in the mean and trend in land-use change emissions over the last decade, (2) a persistent low agreement between the different methods on the magnitude of the land CO2 flux in the northern extra-tropics, and (3) an apparent discrepancy between the different methods for the ocean sink outside the tropics, particularly in the Southern Ocean. This living data update documents changes in the methods and data sets used in this new global carbon budget and the progress in understanding of the global carbon cycle compared with previous publications of this data set (Friedlingstein et al., 2019; Le Qu{\'e}r{\'e} et al., 2018b, a, 2016, 2015b, a, 2014, 2013).

The algorithm operates at a range of scales and combines the results at different scales into a single multiresolution index. This index classifies degrees of valley bottom flatness, which may be related to depth of deposit.

This includes incorporation of areas considered to be underlain by shallow peat soils ({$\geq$} 10~cm and~{$\geq~$}8.6~\% Organic Matter content), and augmentation of the overall test dataset with an additional~{$\sim~$}20,000 points. The workflow for map generation employed 20 Decision Tree Output Maps (DTOMs), aggregated into 33 Map Combinations (MCs). These facilitated the addition of new areas and removal of areas where the presence of peat could not be confidently identified. The MC selected for the update had the highest accuracy metrics ({$\geq$} 74~\%), consisting of DTOMs with a user accuracy~{$\geq~$}66~\% and assessed over a minimum number of test points~{$\geq~$}50. The resulting map reveals peat to underlie 1.66~M~ha of Ireland ({$\sim$} 23.3~\% of the country), identified with values of 83~\% for overall accuracy and F1 score for peat areas. This extent is 13.2~\% larger than that delineated in previous versions and at least 23.2~\% larger than areas presented in other previous maps. The methodology also allows transparency from which data sources can be distinguished to define different key peat thickness ranges ({$\geq$} 10~cm, {$\geq$} 30--40~cm), better facilitating assessment of environmental impacts arising from land use change. This approach has potential relevance for peat mapping globally, notably in areas containing disparate datasets (e.g., land cover, soil map, etc.), or employing different production methods. The accuracy metrics generated also suggest that the approach can be used as a basis for implementing or updating national and international regulations concerning carbon-rich soils in comparable settings to those encountered in Ireland.},

  abstract = {This article presents individual conditional expectation (ICE) plots, a tool for visualizing the model estimated by any supervised learning algorithm. Classical partial dependence plots (PDPs) help visualize the average partial relationship between the predicted response and one or more features. In the presence of substantial interaction effects, the partial response relationship can be heterogeneous. Thus, an average curve, such as the PDP, can obfuscate the complexity of the modeled relationship. Accordingly, ICE plots refine the PDP by graphing the functional relationship between the predicted response and the feature for individual observations. Specifically, ICE plots highlight the variation in the fitted values across the range of a covariate, suggesting where and to what extent heterogeneities might exist. In addition to providing a plotting suite for exploratory analysis, we include a visual test for additive structure in the data-generating model. Through simulated examples and real datasets, we demonstrate how ICE plots can shed light on estimated models in ways PDPs cannot. Procedures outlined are available in the R package ICEbox.},

In high-dimensional regression or classification frameworks, variable selection is a difficult task, that becomes even more challenging in the presence of highly correlated predictors. Firstly we provide a theoretical study of the permutation importance measure for an additive regression model. This allows us to describe how the correlation between predictors impacts the permutation importance. Our results motivate the use of the recursive feature elimination (RFE) algorithm for variable selection in this context. This algorithm recursively eliminates the variables using permutation importance measure as a ranking criterion. Next various simulation experiments illustrate the efficiency of the RFE algorithm for selecting a small number of variables together with a good prediction error. Finally, this selection algorithm is tested on the Landsat Satellite data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.},

  abstract = {Hypothesis testing of variable importance measures (VIMPs) is still the subject of ongoing research. This particularly applies to random forests (RF), for which VIMPs are a popular feature. Among recent developments, heuristic approaches to parametric testing have been proposed whose distributional assumptions are based on empirical evidence. Other formal tests under regularity conditions were derived analytically. But these approaches can be computationally expensive or even practically infeasible. This problem also occurs with non-parametric permutation tests, which are, however, distribution-free and can generically be applied to any kind of prediction model and VIMP. Embracing this advantage, it is proposed to use sequential permutation tests and sequential p-value estimation to reduce the computational costs associated with conventional permutation tests. These costs can be particularly high in case of complex prediction models. Therefore, RF's popular and widely used permutation VIMP (pVIMP) serves as a practical and relevant application example. The results of simulation studies confirm the theoretical properties of the sequential tests, that is, the type-I error probability is controlled at a nominal level and a high power is maintained with considerably fewer permutations needed compared to conventional permutation testing. The numerical stability of the methods is investigated in two additional application studies. In summary, theoretically sound sequential permutation testing of VIMP is possible at greatly reduced computational costs. Recommendations for application are given. A respective implementation for RF's pVIMP is provided through the accompanying R package rfvimptest.},

  abstract = {Tropical peatlands are among the most carbon-dense ecosystems but land-use change has led to the loss of large peatland areas, associated with substantial greenhouse gas emissions. To design effective conservation and restoration policies, maps of the location and carbon storage of tropical peatlands are vital. This is especially so in countries such as Peru where the distribution of its large, hydrologically intact peatlands is poorly known. Here field and remote sensing data support the model development of peatland extent and thickness for lowland Peruvian Amazonia. We estimate a peatland area of 62,714\,km2 (5th and 95th confidence interval percentiles of 58,325 and 67,102\,km2, respectively) and carbon stock of 5.4 (2.6--10.6)\,PgC, a value approaching the entire above-ground carbon stock of Peru but contained within just 5\% of its land area. Combining the map of peatland extent with national land-cover data we reveal small but growing areas of deforestation and associated CO2 emissions from peat decomposition due to conversion to mining, urban areas and agriculture. The emissions from peatland areas classified as forest in 2000 represent 1--4\% of Peruvian CO2 forest emissions between 2000 and 2016. We suggest that bespoke monitoring, protection and sustainable management of tropical peatlands are required to avoid further degradation and CO2 emissions.},

  abstract = {Spatial soil information is essential for informed decision-making in a wide range of fields. Digital soil mapping (DSM) using machine learning algorithms has become a popular approach for generating soil maps. DSM capitalises on the relation between environmental variables (i.e., features) and a soil property of interest. It typically needs a training dataset that covers the feature space well. Mapping in areas where there are no training data is challenging, because extrapolation in geographic space often induces extrapolation in feature space and can seriously deteriorate prediction accuracy. The objective of this study was to analyse the extrapolation effects of random forest DSM models by predicting topsoil properties (OC, clay, and pH) in four African countries using soil data from the ISRIC Africa Soil Profiles database. The study was conducted in eight experiments whereby soil data from one or three countries were used to predict in the other countries. We calculated similarities between donor and recipient areas using four measures, including soil type similarity, homosoil, dissimilarity index by area of applicability (AOA), and quantile regression forest (QRF) prediction interval width. The aim was to determine the level of agreement between these four measures and identify the method that had the strongest agreement with common validation metrics. The results indicated a positive correlation between soil type similarity, homosoil and dissimilarity index by AOA. Surprisingly, we observed a negative correlation between dissimilarity index by AOA and QRF prediction interval width. Although the cross-validation results for the trained models were acceptable, the extrapolation results were unsatisfactory, highlighting the risk of extrapolation. Using soil data from three countries instead of one increased the similarities for all measures, but it had a limited effect on improving extrapolation. Also, none of the measures had a strong correlation with the validation metrics. This was particularly disappointing for AOA and QRF, which we had expected to be strong indicators of extrapolation prediction performance. Results showed that homosoil and soil type methods had the strongest correlation with validation metrics. The results for this case study revealed limitations of using AOA and QRF as measures of extrapolation effects, highlighting the importance of not relying on these methods blindly. Further research and more case studies are needed to address the effects of extrapolation of DSM models.},

  abstract = {Aim To propose a species distribution modelling framework and its companion ``iSDM'' R package for predicting the potential and realized distributions of invasive species within the invaded range. Location Northern France. Methods The non-equilibrium distribution of invasive species with the environment within the invaded range affects the environmental representativeness of species presence--absence data collected from the field and introduces uncertainty in observed absences as these may either reflect unsuitable sites or be incidental. To address these issues, we here propose an environmental systematic sampling design to collect presence--absence data from the field and a probability index to sort and subsequently separate environmental absences (EAs: reflecting environmentally unsuitable sites) from dispersal-limited absences (DLAs: reflecting sites out of dispersal reach). We first conducted a comprehensive test based on a virtual species to evaluate the performance of our framework. Then, we applied it on different life stages of a non-native tree species (Prunus serotina Ehrh.) invasive in Europe. Results Regarding the potential distribution, we found higher model performances for both the virtual species (true skill statistics (TSS) {$>$} 0.75) and P. serotina (TSS {$\geq$} 0.68) after carefully selecting absences with a low probability to be DLAs compared with classical models that incorporate both EAs and DLAs (e.g. TSS = 0.11 for P. serotina with 80\% of DLAs). On the contrary, both EAs and DLAs as well as dispersal-related covariates were needed to capture the realized distribution of both the virtual species and P. serotina. Main Conclusions Our framework helps overcoming the conceptual and methodological limitations of the disequilibrium in species' distribution models inherent to invasive species and enables managers to robustly estimate both the realized and potential distributions of invasive species. Although more relevant for modelling the distribution of non-native species, this framework can also be applied to native species.},

  abstract = {Accurate and high resolution spatial soil information is essential for efficient and sustainable land use, management and conservation. Since the establishment of digital soil mapping (DSM) and the goals set by the GlobalSoilMap (GSM) working group, great advances have been made to attain spatial soil information worldwide. Highly populated areas such as the Netherlands demand multi-functional land use, for which information of key soil properties such as pH is essential to make decisions. We a) provide soil pH prediction maps at six standard depth layers between 0~m to 2~m for the Netherlands at 25~m resolution, whereby the calibrated Quantile Regression Forest (QRF) model allows for prediction at any desired depth, and b) determine map accuracy using various statistical validation strategies and evaluation of prediction uncertainty. This study is unique among GSM products by including design-based inference of a probability sample as an external accuracy assessment and providing Tier 4 maps with spatially explicit accuracy thresholds for end-users based on GSM specifications. QRF models were tuned and calibrated using 15338 soil observations between 0~m and 2~m depth from 4230 locations and 195 covariates representing the soil-forming factors. The following statistical validation strategies were used for external accuracy assessment of map quality: out-of-bag, location-grouped 10-fold cross-validation, an independent validation set (5677 observations, 1367 locations) and a stratified random sample of the independent validation set separated by depth layer. Mean error (ME), root mean squared error (RMSE), model efficiency coefficient (MEC) and the prediction interval coverage probability (PICP) were calculated in all four strategies. In addition, the 90th prediction intervals were used to categorize each 25~m pixel into ``none'', A, AA or AAA quality as a measure of the internal accuracy assessment. We obtained large differences depending on the four external accuracy assessment strategies and depth layer (ME = -0.08--0.20, RMSE ~=~0.41--0.83, MEC ~=~0.64--0.90, PICP of PI90 ~=~0.80--0.94). Design-based inference (LSK-SRS) was most indicative of map accuracy based on sampling theory (ME ~=~0.09--0.17, RMSE ~=~0.7--0.79, MEC ~=~0.73--0.82). QRF prediction uncertainty was slightly overestimated. Less than 10\% of pixels were designated with AA and AAA and therefore we recommend future studies to also test the achievability of high quality thresholds for Tier 4 GSM maps. We believe these 3D soil pH maps at 25~m resolution are useful for a variety of end users and that our workflow can be applied elsewhere and for other soil properties to further diminish the gap of missing spatial soil information.},

  abstract = {A methodological framework for spatial prediction based on regression-kriging is described and compared with ordinary kriging and plain regression. The data are first transformed using logit transformation for target variables and factor analysis for continuous predictors (auxiliary maps). The target variables are then fitted using step-wise regression and residuals interpolated using kriging. A generic visualisation method is used to simultaneously display predictions and associated uncertainty. The framework was tested using 135 profile observations from the national survey in Croatia, divided into interpolation (100) and validation sets (35). Three target variables: organic matter, pH in topsoil and topsoil thickness were predicted from six relief parameters and nine soil mapping units. Prediction efficiency was evaluated using the mean error and root mean square error (RMSE) of prediction at validation points. The results show that the proposed framework improves efficiency of predictions. Moreover, it ensured normality of residuals and enforced prediction values to be within the physical range of a variable. For organic matter, it achieved lower relative RMSE than ordinary kriging (53.3\% versus 66.5\%). For topsoil thickness, it achieved a lower relative RMSE (66.5\% versus 83.3\%) and a lower bias than ordinary kriging (0.15 versus 0.69 cm). The prediction of pH in topsoil was difficult with all three methods. This framework can adopt both continuous and categorical soil variables in a semi-automated or automated manner. It opens a possibility to develop a bundle algorithm that can be implemented in a GIS to interpolate soil profile data from existing datasets.},

  abstract = {Random forest and similar Machine Learning techniques are already used to generate spatial predictions, but spatial location of points (geography) is often ignored in the modeling process. Spatial auto-correlation, especially if still existent in the cross-validation residuals, indicates that the predictions are maybe biased, and this is suboptimal. This paper presents a random forest for spatial predictions framework (RFsp) where buffer distances from observation points are used as explanatory variables, thus incorporating geographical proximity effects into the prediction process. The RFsp framework is illustrated with examples that use textbook datasets and apply spatial and spatio-temporal prediction to numeric, binary, categorical, multivariate and spatiotemporal variables. Performance of the RFsp framework is compared with the state-of-the-art kriging techniques using fivefold cross-validation with refitting. The results show that RFsp can obtain equally accurate and unbiased predictions as different versions of kriging. Advantages of using RFsp over kriging are that it needs no rigid statistical assumptions about the distribution and stationarity of the target variable, it is more flexible towards incorporating, combining and extending covariates of different types, and it possibly yields more informative maps characterizing the prediction error. RFsp appears to be especially attractive for building multivariate spatial prediction models that can be used as ``knowledge engines'' in various geoscience fields. Some disadvantages of RFsp are the exponentially growing computational intensity with increase of calibration data and covariates and the high sensitivity of predictions to input data quality. The key to the success of the RFsp framework might be the training data quality---especially quality of spatial sampling (to minimize extrapolation problems and any type of bias in data), and quality of model validation (to ensure that accuracy is not effected by overfitting).

  abstract = {Peatlands are vital ecosystems providing crucial ecological services such as significant carbon storage in the context of climate change. These sensitive ecosystems are subjected to degradation due to land use change. In this context, it is important to understand the actual state of degraded peatlands and their recovery potential for regaining important functions. This study focuses on a disturbed peatland in the Belgian Hautes Fagnes, previously drained and planted with spruce, and characterized by a topographic gradient. We aimed to elucidate the use of Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) and Electromagnetic induction (EMI) techniques in characterizing such peatlands, with a specific focus on their implications for peat depth and electrical conductivity assessment, related to peatland degradation. The GPR revealed a high spatial heterogeneity in peat depth, ranging from 0.2 to more than 2~m on the site. In contrast, an EMI instrument used with single coil spacing proved to be unsuccessful to deduce peat depth but demonstrated potential for the delineation of zones of mineral soil. It is also shown that the links between soil physical and chemical properties and its bulk soil electrical conductivity (ECa) measured by EMI are complex in zones of shallower peat. Additionally, this study highlights the role of pore water conductivity in influencing temporal variations in ECa. Our findings explain the intricate interplay between peat depth, topography and ECa in disturbed peatlands. The results of this study may be of substantial societal interest, as it provides insights into techniques for the rapid non destructive characterization of the conditions of previously drained peatlands.},

  abstract = {For the better part of the 20th century pedologists mapped soil by drawing boundaries between different classes of soil which they identified from survey on foot or by vehicle, supplemented by air-photo interpretation, and backed by an understanding of landscape and the processes by which soil is formed. Its limitations for representing gradual spatial variation and predicting conditions at unvisited sites became evident, and in the 1980s the introduction of geostatistics and specifically ordinary kriging revolutionized thinking and to a large extent practice. Ordinary kriging is based solely on sample data of the variable of interest---it takes no account of related covariates. The latter were incorporated from the 1990s onward as fixed effects and incorporated as regression predictors, giving rise to kriging with external drift and regression kriging. Simultaneous estimation of regression coefficients and variogram parameters is best done by residual maximum likelihood estimation. In recent years machine learning has become feasible for predicting soil conditions from huge sets of environmental data obtained from sensors aboard satellites and other sources to produce digital soil maps. The techniques are based on classification and regression, but they take no account of spatial correlations. Further, they are effectively `black boxes'; they lack transparency, and their output needs to be validated if they are to be trusted. They undoubtedly have merit; they are here to stay. They too, however, have their shortcomings when applied to spatial data, which spatial statisticians can help overcome. Spatial statisticians and pedometricians still have much to do to incorporate uncertainty into digital predictions, spatial averages and totals over regions, and to take into account errors in measurement and spatial positions of sample data. They must also communicate their understanding of these uncertainties to end users of soil maps, by whatever means they are made.},

This paper compares four such strategies, namely, `random', `regular', `proportional-stratified' and `equal-stratified'---to investigate (1) how they affect prediction accuracy and (2) how sensitive they are to sample size. In order to compare them, a virtual species approach (Ecol. Model. 145 (2001) 111) in a real landscape, based on reliable data, was chosen. The distribution of the virtual species was sampled 300 times using each of the four strategies in four sample sizes. The sampled data were then fed into a GLM to make two types of prediction: (1) habitat suitability and (2) presence/absence. Comparing the predictions to the known distribution of the virtual species allows model accuracy to be assessed. Habitat suitability predictions were assessed by Pearson's correlation coefficient and presence/absence predictions by Cohen's {$\kappa$} agreement coefficient. The results show the `regular' and `equal-stratified' sampling strategies to be the most accurate and most robust. We propose the following characteristics to improve sample design: (1) increase sample size, (2) prefer systematic to random sampling and (3) include environmental information in the design.},

  abstract = {Aim Many countries lack informative, high-resolution, wall-to-wall vegetation or land cover maps. Such maps are useful for land use and nature management, and for input to regional climate and hydrological models. Land cover maps based on remote sensing data typically lack the required ecological information, whereas traditional field-based mapping is too expensive to be carried out over large areas. In this study, we therefore explore the extent to which distribution modelling (DM) methods are useful for predicting the current distribution of vegetation types (VT) on a national scale. Location Mainland Norway, covering ca. 324,000 km2. Methods We used presence/absence data for 31 different VTs, mapped wall-to-wall in an area frame survey with 1081 rectangular plots of 0.9 km2. Distribution models for each VT were obtained by logistic generalised linear modelling, using stepwise forward selection with an F-ratio test. A total of 116 explanatory variables, recorded in 100 m {\texttimes} 100 m grid cells, were used. The 31 models were evaluated by applying the AUC criterion to an independent evaluation dataset. Results Twenty-one of the 31 models had AUC values higher than 0.8. The highest AUC value (0.989) was obtained for Poor/rich broadleaf deciduous forest, whereas the lowest AUC (0.671) was obtained for Lichen and heather spruce forest. Overall, we found that rare VTs are predicted better than common ones, and coastal VTs are predicted better than inland ones. Conclusions Our study establishes DM as a viable tool for spatial prediction of aggregated species-based entities such as VTs on a regional scale and at a fine (100 m) spatial resolution, provided relevant predictor variables are available. We discuss the potential uses of distribution models in utilizing large-scale international vegetation surveys. We also argue that predictions from such models may improve parameterisation of vegetation distribution in earth system models.},

  abstract = {Organic horizons including peat deposits are important terrestrial carbon pools, and various chemical, biological, and water exchange processes take place within them. Accurate information on the spatial distribution of organic soils and their properties is important for decision-making and land management. In this study, we present a machine learning approach for mapping the distribution of organic soils and determining the thickness of the peat layer using more than 24,000 peat layer thickness measurements obtained from field data, airborne laser scanning (ALS) data and various indices obtained from therein, as well as other cartographic materials. Our objectives encompassed two primary aims. Firstly, we endeavored to develop updated cartographic materials depicting the spatial distribution of peat layers. Secondly, we aimed to predict the depth of peat layers, thereby enhancing our understanding of soil organic carbon content. Continentality, a wet area map, latitude, a depth to water map with catchment area of 10 ha, and a digital elevation model were the most important covariates for the machine learning model. As a result, we obtained a map with three peat layer thickness classes, an overall classification accuracy of 0.88, and a kappa value of 0.74. This research contributes to a better understanding of organic soil dynamics and facilitates improved assessments of soil organic carbon stocks.},

  abstract = {Terrain mobility is directly dependent on soil properties, i.e. stoniness, soil particle size and peat depth. Gamma-ray spectrometry has been widely used in soil mapping as gamma-rays can penetrate up to 50 cm of soil. The method has proven to be effective in gathering information on various soil properties, such as clay and silt content, organic carbon content, soil pH, and soil stoniness. The intensity of gamma radiation decreases with increasing soil moisture content, which is important when assessing the load-bearing capacity of forest terrain, which affects the quality and planning of mechanized wood harvesting. In this study, we compared two gamma-ray datasets that were acquired from the same plots but measured with different methods: airborne gamma-ray spectrometry and a handheld gamma-ray spectrometer. Regression analyses were used to examine whether the gamma-ray datasets have significant similarities. Linear discriminant analysis was then used to study the performance of the two gamma-ray datasets when predicting different soil properties (stoniness index classes (SIC), soil depth, and peat depth). Our correlation analysis produced R2 values of 0.18--0.29 and root mean square error (RMSE\%) values of 0.48--0.55. Prediction of SIC was 67.1\% accurate with ground gamma and 45.9\% accurate with air gamma. For soil depth predictions, the accuracies were 64.7--70.0\% for ground gamma and 61.7--63.5\% for air gamma. Our findings showed that ground gamma-ray spectrometry is better at predicting soil properties than air gamma-ray spectrometry.},

The theory being tested is that gamma radiation from rocks is attenuated by overlying peat. Improved peat depth models produced though the integration and calibration of the Tellus data against known peat depths are used to improve carbon stock estimations. A 6km test line of the airborne survey is undertaken every 4-6 weeks and flown at a series of different elevations to allow the data to be assessed temporally with different saturation levels. An associated field survey takes place every 4-6 weeks to obtain data on the ground to correspond as closely as possible to the timing of the airborne flight survey. Analysis techniques on the ground include magnetometry, resistivity, radiometrics, moisture content, GPR and peat probing. Results for the airborne flight survey and ground-based data collection indicate that similarities between the traces can be identified. Ground validation enables the effect of changes in factors such as soil moisture to be assessed for the airborne radiometric data.},

  abstract = {Soil carbon stores are a major component of the annual returns required by EU governments to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Peat has a high proportion of soil carbon due to the relatively high carbon density of peat and organic-rich soils. For this reason it has become increasingly important to measure and model soil carbon stores and changes in peat stocks to facilitate the management of carbon changes over time. The approach investigated in this research evaluates the use of airborne geophysical (radiometric) data to estimate peat thickness using the attenuation of bedrock geology radioactivity by superficial peat cover. Remotely sensed radiometric data are validated with ground peat depth measurements combined with non-invasive geophysical surveys. Two field-based case studies exemplify and validate the results. Variography and kriging are used to predict peat thickness from point measurements of peat depth and airborne radiometric data and provide an estimate of uncertainty in the predictions. Cokriging, by assessing the degree of spatial correlation between recent remote sensed geophysical monitoring and previous peat depth models, is used to examine changes in peat stocks over time. The significance of the coregionalisation is that the spatial cross correlation between the remote and ground based data can be used to update the model of peat depth. The result is that by integrating remotely sensed data with ground geophysics, the need is reduced for extensive ground-based monitoring and invasive peat depth measurements. The overall goal is to provide robust estimates of peat thickness to improve estimates of carbon stocks. The implications from the research have a broader significance that promotes a reduction in the need for damaging onsite peat thickness measurement and an increase in the use of remote sensed data for carbon stock estimations.},

Regression Kriging (RK) is one of the most popular, practical and robust hybrid spatial interpolation techniques in the digital soil mapper's toolbox that enables the modeling of soil distribution patterns at multiple scales in space and time. Several theoretical and applied aspects of RK have been discussed; however, there are no review studies, which quantify the essential factors affecting the performance of RK. Materials for this review were gathered from high-quality international soil science journals: Catena, Geoderma, and Soil Science Society of America from 2004 to 2014. A total of 142 different models from 40 different articles were examined. The following criteria were considered to evaluate their impacts on the prediction efficiency of RK: i) soil geographic region, ii) area of extent, iii) spatial resolution, iv) target soil properties and/or classes v) sampling design, vi) sampling size and density, vii) sample depth viii) soil-environmental factors as predictors, ix) methods of transformation, x) factor analysis, xi) regression type, xii) model used for variogram, xiii) nugget to total sill ratio, xiv) spatial autocorrelation range, xv) coefficient of variation of observed dataset, xvi) evaluation method (note that in previous publications the term `validation' has been used extensively in publications in pedometrics) and xvii) coefficient of determination. The historical development of RK, limitations and strengths of current RK studies, research gaps, and future trends in RK are discussed. A major finding is the inverse relationship between the accuracy of RK models and the variation of soil properties in the original datasets. Novel modified RK methods are proposed for further investigation to predict soil properties and classes.},

  abstract = {Digital soil mapping (DSM) increasingly makes use of machine learning algorithms to identify relationships between soil properties and multiple covariates that can be detected across landscapes. Selecting the appropriate algorithm for model building is critical for optimizing results in the context of the available data. Over the past decade, many studies have tested different machine learning (ML) approaches on a variety of soil data sets. Here, we review the application of some of the most popular ML algorithms for digital soil mapping. Specifically, we compare the strengths and weaknesses of multiple linear regression (MLR), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector regression (SVR), Cubist, random forest (RF), and artificial neural networks (ANN) for DSM. These algorithms were compared on the basis of five factors: (1) quantity of hyperparameters, (2) sample size, (3) covariate selection, (4) learning time, and (5) interpretability of the resulting model. If training time is a limitation, then algorithms that have fewer model parameters and hyperparameters should be considered, e.g., MLR, KNN, SVR, and Cubist. If the data set is large (thousands of samples) and computation time is not an issue, ANN would likely produce the best results. If the data set is small ({$<$}100), then Cubist, KNN, RF, and SVR are likely to perform better than ANN and MLR. The uncertainty in predictions produced by Cubist, KNN, RF, and SVR may not decrease with large datasets. When interpretability of the resulting model is important to the user, Cubist, MLR, and RF are more appropriate algorithms as they do not function as ``black boxes.'' There is no one correct approach to produce models for predicting the spatial distribution of soil properties. Nonetheless, some algorithms are more appropriate than others considering the nature of the data and purpose of mapping activity.},

  abstract = {The Geological Survey of Sweden (SGU) has been conducting airborne gamma spectrometry measurements of natural radioactivity in Sweden for more than 40 years. Today, the database covers about 80\% of the country's land surface. This article explores the first step of putting this data into use in radioactive source search at ground level. However, in order to be able to use the airborne background measurements at ground level, SGU data must be validated against terrestrial data. In this work, we compare the SGU data with data measured by a portable backpack system. This is done for three different areas in southern Sweden. The statistical analysis shows that a linear relationship and a positive correlation exist between the air and ground data. However, this linear relationship could be revealed only when the region possessed large enough variations in areal activity. Furthermore, the activity distributions measured show good agreement to those of SGU. We conclude that the SGU database could be used for terrestrial background assessment, given that a linear transfer function is established.},

  abstract = {Pristine peatlands being excellent storage for terrestrial Carbon (C) play a crucial role in regulating climate and water and provide several important ecosystem services. However, peatlands have been heavily altered (e.g., by draining the water table), increasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Restoring peatlands requires a comprehensive characterization, including knowledge of peat depth (PD; m). Traditionally, this requires the physical insertion of a push probe, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. It has been shown that non-invasive proximal sensing techniques such as electromagnetic induction and ground penetrating radar can add value to PD data. In this research, we want to assess the potential of proximally sensed gamma-ray ({$\gamma$}-ray) spectrometry (i.e., potassium [K], thorium [Th], uranium [U], and the count rate [CR]) and terrain attributes data (i.e., elevation, slope, SAGAWI, and MRVBF) to map PD either alone or in combination across a small (10~ha) peatland area in {\O}Bakker, Denmark. Here, the PD varies from 0.1~m in the south to 7.3~m in the north. We use various prediction models including ordinary kriging (OK) of PD, linear regression (LR), multiple LR (MLR), LR kriging (LRK), MLR kriging (MLRK) and empirical Bayesian kriging regression (EBKR). We also determine the minimum calibration sample size required by decreasing sample size in decrements (i.e., n~=~100, 90, 80,{\dots}, 30). We compare these approaches using prediction agreement (Lin's concordance correlation coefficient; LCCC) and accuracy (root mean square error; RMSE). The results show that OK using maximum calibration size (n~=~108) had near perfect agreement (0.97) and accuracy (0.59~m), compared to LR (ln CR; 0.65 and 0.78~m, respectively) and MLR (ln K, Th, CR and elevation; 0.85 and 0.63~m). Improvements are achieved by adding residuals; LRK (0.95 and 0.71~m) and MLRK (0.96 and 0.51~m). The best results were obtained using EBKR (0.97 and 0.63~m) given all predictions were positive and no significant change in agreement and standard errors with the decrement of calibration sample size (e.g., n~=~30). The results have implications towards C stocks assessment and improved land use planning to control GHG emissions and slow down global warming.},

  abstract = {Pristine peatlands are precious for their Carbon (C) storage ability and the vast range of ecosystem services they provide. Globally, peatlands were heavily altered over the years especially by draining the water table for meeting energy and agricultural needs. Draining the peat results in its enhanced microbial decomposition, increased dissolved C leaching and increased susceptibility to peat fires, thus turning peatlands into C-source ecosystems. Currently, the carbon dioxide (CO2) released from degraded peatlands amounts to approximately 5\% of global anthropogenic emissions. Climate change concerns have sparked an interest to reduce these emissions and different initiatives are put forward for the protection, proper management, and restoration of the peatlands. Denmark has its own national goal of reducing CO2 emissions by 70\% by 2030; of which agriculture is expected to be a significant contributor. Comprehensive characterization of peat inventory providing status on the C stocks, water table depths and emissions is required for improved land use planning as almost 4.8 million tonnes of CO2 per annum is released from cultivated organic lands ({\textasciitilde} 170,000 ha in total). To achieve this, measurements of peat depth (PD) for volume characterization are invaluable. The conventional mapping approach of PD using peat probes is laborious, time-consuming, and provides only localized and discrete measurements. In addition, these manual probing measurements are also prone to errors as occasionally the probes are obstructed by stones, wood and human artefacts causing underestimation and other times they might easily penetrate the soil underlying the actual peat causing overestimation. In Denmark, we are comparing and contrasting the suitability of different electromagnetic sensors, precisely, working on electromagnetic induction (EMI), ground penetrating radar (GPR), and gamma-ray radiometric (GR) principles to accurately characterize the Danish peatlands. We are testing the sensors on both ground-based and air-borne configurations to improve the feasibility, increase accessibility and save costs. A novel drone-based transient EMI sensor is being designed in this direction. So far the results suggest that the EMI and GR techniques are promising to demarcate the peatland boundaries and estimate the PDs up to a certain extent; depending on the gradient in transition between the mineral and organic soils. Ground penetrating radar provided unequivocal results in high-resistive ombrotrophic peat while failing in low-resistive minerotrophic peat due to low signal penetration. In the drone-borne configuration, GR proved superior due to its ease of use and less to no success was achieved using a GPR. Moving forward, we plan on fusing the multisensor datasets using machine learning to improve the prediction accuracy of PDs, find a means for mapping water table depths and perform advanced modelling for comprehending the effects of different management scenarios on CO2 emissions.},

  abstract = {Boreal peatlands play a major role in carbon and water cycling and other global environmental processes but understanding this role is constrained by inconsistent representation of peatlands on, or omission from, many global land cover maps. The comparison of several widely used global and continental-scale databases on peatland distribution with a detailed map for the St. Petersburg region of Russia showed significant under-reporting of peatland area, or even total omission. Analysis of the spatial agreement and disagreement with the detailed regional map indicated that the error of comission (overestimation) was significantly lower than the error of omission (underestimation) which means, that overall, peatlands were correctly classified as such in coarse resolution datasets but a large proportion (74--99\%) was overlooked. The coarse map resolution alone caused significant omission of peatlands in the study region. In comparison to categorical maps, continuous field mapping approach utilizing MODIS sensor data showed potential for a greatly improved representation of peatlands on coarse resolution maps. Analysis of spectral signatures of peatlands with different types of surface vegetation suggested that improved mapping of boreal peatlands on categorical maps is feasible. The lower reflectance of treeless peatlands in the near- and shortwave-infrared parts of the electromagnetic spectrum is consistent with the spectral signature of sphagnum mosses. However, when trees are present, the canopy architecture appears to be more important in defining the overall spectral reflectance of peatlands. A research focus on developing remote sensing methods for boreal peatlands is needed for adequate characterization of their global distribution.},

  abstract = {It has long been acknowledged that the soil spatial samplings used as inputs to DSM models are strong drivers -- and often limiting factors -- of the performances of such models. However, few studies have focused on evaluating this impact and identifying the related spatial sampling characteristics. In this study, a numerical experiment was conducted on this topic using the pseudo values of topsoil clay content obtained from an airborne Visible Near InfraRed-Short Wave InfraRed (Vis-NIR-SWIR) hyperspectral image in the Cap Bon region (Tunisia) as the source of the spatial sampling. Twelve thousand DSM models were built by running a Random Forest algorithm from soil spatial sampling of different sizes and average spacings (from 200~m to 2000~m) and different spatial distributions (from clustered to regularly distributed), aiming to mimic the various situations encountered when handling legacy data. These DSM models were evaluated with regard to both their prediction performances and their ability to estimate their overall and local uncertainties. Three evaluation methods were applied: a model-based one, a classical model-free one using 25\% of the sites removed from the initial soil data, and a reference one using a set of 100,000 independent sites selected by stratified random sampling over the entire region. The results showed that: 1) While, as expected, the performances of the DSM models increased when the spacing of the sample increased, this increase was diminished for the smallest spacing as soon as 50\% of the spatially structured variance was captured by the sampling, 2) Sampling that provided complete and even distributions in the geographical space and had as great spread of the target soil property as possible increased the DSM performances, while complete and even sampling distributions in the covariate space had less impacts, 3) Systematic underestimations of the overall uncertainty of DSM models were observed, that were all the more important that the sparse samplings poorly covered the real distribution of the target soil property and that the dense sampling were unevenly distributed in the geographical space, 4) The local uncertainties were underestimated for sparse sampling and over-estimated for dense sampling while being sensitive to the same sampling characteristics as overall uncertainty. Such finding have practical outcomes on sampling strategies and DSM model evaluation that are discussed.},

  abstract = {This article reviews the current research and applications of various digital soil mapping (DSM) techniques used to map Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) concentration and stocks following a systematic mapping approach from 2013 until present (18 February 2019). It is intended that this review of relevant literature will assist prospective researchers by identifying knowledge clusters and gaps in relation to the digital mapping of SOC. Of 120 studies, most were clustered in some specific countries such as China, Australia and the USA. The highest number publications were in 2016 and 2017. Regarding the predictive models, there was a progression from Linear Models towards Machine Learning (ML) techniques, and hybrid models in Regression Kriging (RK) framework performed better than individual models. Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) was the most frequently used method for predicting SOC, although it was outperformed by other ML techniques in most studies. Random Forest (RF) was found to perform better than MLR and other ML techniques in most comparative studies. Other common and competitive techniques were Cubist, Neural Network (NN), Boosted Regression Tree (BRT), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR). Due to the inconsistency in various comparative studies, it would be advisable to calibrate the competitive algorithms using specific experimental datasets. This review also reveals the environmental covariates that have been identified as the most important by RF technique in recent years in regard to digital mapping of SOC, which may assist in selecting optimum sets of environmental covariates for mapping SOC. Covariates representing organism/organic activities were among the most frequent among top five covariates, followed by the variables representing climate and topography. Climate was reported to be influential in determining the variation in SOC level at regional scales, followed by parent materials, topography and land use. However, for mapping at a resolution that represents smaller areas such as a farm- or plot-scale, land use and vegetation indices were stated to be more influential in predicting SOC. Furthermore, unlike a previous review work, all recent studies in this review incorporated validation and 41\% of them estimated spatially explicit prediction of uncertainty. Only 9.16\% studies performed external validation, whereas most studies used data-splitting and cross-validation techniques which may not be the best options for datasets obtained through non-probability sampling.},

  abstract = {The Greater Maasai Mara Ecosystem (GMME) in Kenya is an iconic savanna ecosystem of high importance as natural and cultural heritage, notably by including the largest remaining seasonal migration of African ungulates and the semi-nomadic pastoralist Maasai culture. Comprehensive mapping of vegetation distribution and dynamics in GMME is important for understanding ecosystem changes across time and space since recent reports suggest dramatic declines in wildlife populations alongside troubling reports of grassland conversion to cropland and habitat fragmentation due to increasing small-holder fencing. Here, we present the first comprehensive vegetation map of GMME at high (10-m) spatial resolution. The map consists of nine key vegetation cover types (VCTs), which were derived in a two-step process integrating data from high-resolution WorldView-3 images (1.2-m) and Sentinel-2 images using a deep-learning workflow. We evaluate the role of anthropogenic, topographic, and climatic factors in affecting the fractional cover of the identified VCTs in 2017 and their MODIS-derived browning/greening rates in the preceding 17~years at 250-m resolution. Results show that most VCTs showed a preceding greening trend in the protected land. In contrast, the semi- and unprotected land showed a general preceding greening trend in the woody-dominated cover types, while they exhibited browning trends in grass-dominated cover types. These results suggest that woody vegetation densification may be happening across much of the GMME, alongside vegetation declines within the non-woody covers in the semi- and unprotected lands. Greening and potential woody densification in GMME is positively correlated with mean annual precipitation and negatively correlated with anthropogenic pressure. Increasing woody densification across the entire GMME in the future would replace high-quality grass cover and pose a risk to the maintenance of the region's rich savanna megafauna, thus pointing to a need for further investigation using alternative data sources. The increasing availability of high-resolution remote sensing and efficient approaches for vegetation mapping will play a crucial role in monitoring conservation effectiveness as well as ecosystem dynamics due to pressures such as climate change.},

The particular design's specification depends on the field of application. Against this background, the author strives to draw the attention to the conceptual shortcomings of conditioned Latin hypercube sampling (cLHS) in the context of soil survey and digital soil mapping. Furthermore, a new sampling design is presented which (1) combines the advantages of both, stratified and balanced designs, (2) shows consistency in the application of pedogenetic theory, and (3) which can be obtained by some simple modifications to the computer code of cLHS. Overall, this manuscript shall promote a vivid discussion in the Pedometrics community concerning the consideration of scientific domain knowledge in statistical sampling theory.},

  abstract = {Peatlands store a large amount of carbon. However, peatlands are complex ecosystems, and acquiring reliable estimates of how much carbon is stored underneath the Earth's surface is inherently challenging, even at small scales. Here, we aim to establish links between the above- and below-ground factors that control soil carbon status, identify the key environmental variables associated with carbon storage, as well as to explore the potential for using Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) remote sensing for spatial mapping of peatlands. We combine UAVs equipped with Red-Green-Blue (RGB), multispectral, thermal infrared, and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors with ground-penetrating radar (GPR) technology and traditional field surveys to provide a comprehensive, 3-dimensional mapping of a peatland hillslope-floodplain landscape in the Belgian Hautes Fagnes. Our results indicate that both peat thickness and soil organic carbon (SOC) stock (top 1~m) are spatially heterogeneous and that the contributions from the surface topography to peat thickness and SOC stock varied from micro- to macro-scales. Peat thickness was more strongly controlled by macro-topography (R2~=~0.46) than SOC stock, which was more influenced by micro-topography (R2~=~0.21). Current vegetation had little predictive power for explaining their spatial variability. Additionally, the UAV data provided accurate estimates of both peat thickness and SOC stock, with RMSE and R2 values of 0.16~m and 0.85 for the peat thickness, and 59.25~t/ha and 0.85 for the SOC stock. However, similar performance can already be achieved by using only topographical data from the LiDAR sensor (for peat thickness) and a combination of peat thickness and topography (for SOC stock) as predictor variables. Our study bridges the gap between surface observations and the hidden carbon reservoir below. This not only allows us to improve our ability to assess the spatial distribution of SOC stocks, but also contributes to our understanding of the environmental factors associated with SOC storage in these highly heterogeneous landscapes, providing insights for environmental science and climate projections.},

  abstract = {Soil information is critical for a wide range of land resource and environmental decisions. These decisions will be compromised when the soil information quality is unsatisfactory. Thus, users of soil information need to understand and consider the uncertainty of the available soil information and be able to judge whether it is fit for purpose. The uncertainty information provided with the SoilGrids2.0 product was examined in a case study. We hypothesised that the soil property predictions for the Netherlands (NL) might be less uncertain than those of New Zealand (NZ) because there were more relevant training data for NL than for NZ. The study objectives were to: 1)understand whether the provided uncertainty information is correct for both countries; 2)explore spatial patterns and relationships in the prediction error and uncertainty information using quantitative tools and new graphical analyses; 3)analyse whether these patterns and relations can be explained; and 4)explore how the uncertainty information and insights derived from graphical analyses might assist an end user to determine whether a map is suitable for their purpose. The study focused on soil texture. Independent datasets showed that the SoilGrids 2.0 uncertainty information was too optimistic for sand and too pessimistic for clay for both countries. The graphical analyses confirmed the initial assumption that NL predictions were more accurate than those for NZ, but they also indicated that some locations in NL have high uncertainty. The graphical analyses allowed only a limited identification of the four sources of uncertainty in digital soil maps, but were quite insightful in helping us to better understand the reliability of the information. A set of recommendations was developed for both producers and consumers of digital soil mapping (DSM) products. This includes the provision of a summary map of accuracy classes. We suggest that more research and educational effort is needed to ensure that digital soil maps are used appropriately.},

The present review restricts itself to those classification systems which focus on peatlands as ecosystems. Such systems are in broad agreement that there is a significant ecological difference between mires which are waterlogged by groundwater or accumulated surface water, broadly known as `fens', and mires which are waterlogged only through direct precipitation, broadly termed `bogs'. Within these broad concepts, however, mires have been variously classified according to their vegetation, their chemistry, their source of water and their hydromorphology. This last system of classification is widely employed, and its hierarchical, or `Tope', approach offers the potential to incorporate other classification systems at various levels within the hierarchy.},

  abstract = {Random and spatial cross-validation (CV) methods are commonly used to evaluate machine-learning-based spatial prediction models, and the performance values obtained are often interpreted as map accuracy estimates. However, the appropriateness of such approaches is currently the subject of controversy. For the common case where no probability sample for validation purposes is available, in Mil{\`a} et al. (2022) we proposed the nearest-neighbour distance matching (NNDM) leave-one-out (LOO) CV method. This method produces a distribution of geographical nearest-neighbour distances (NNDs) between test and training locations during CV that matches the distribution of NNDs between prediction and training locations. Hence, it creates predictive conditions during CV that are comparable to what is required when predicting a defined area. Although NNDM LOO CV produced largely reliable map accuracy estimates in our analysis, as a LOO-based method, it cannot be applied to the large datasets found in many studies.  Here, we propose a novel k-fold CV strategy for map accuracy estimation inspired by the concepts of NNDM LOO CV: the k-fold NNDM (kNNDM) CV. The kNNDM algorithm tries to find a k-fold configuration such that the empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) of NNDs between test and training locations during CV is matched to the ECDF of NNDs between prediction and training locations.  We tested kNNDM CV in a simulation study with different sampling distributions and compared it to other CV methods including NNDM LOO CV. We found that kNNDM CV performed similarly to NNDM LOO CV and produced reasonably reliable map accuracy estimates across sampling patterns. However, compared to NNDM LOO CV, kNNDM resulted in significantly reduced computation times. In an experiment using 4000 strongly clustered training points, kNNDM CV reduced the time spent on fold assignment and model training from 4.8 d to 1.2 min. Furthermore, we found a positive association between the quality of the match of the two ECDFs in kNNDM and the reliability of the map accuracy estimates.  kNNDM provided the advantages of our original NNDM LOO CV strategy while bypassing its sample size limitations.},

Two types of sampling design for calibrating the prediction models are compared: conditioned Latin hypercube sampling (CLHS) and feature space coverage sampling (FSCS). Simple random sampling (SRS), which does not utilize the environmental features, is added as a reference design. The sample sizes used are 20, 30, 40, 50, 75, and 100 points, and at each sample size 100 sample sets were drawn using each of the three types of design. Each of these sample sets was then used to calibrate three prediction models: random forest (RF), individual predictive soil mapping (iPSM), and multinomial logistic regression (MLR). These sampling designs were compared based on the overall accuracy of predicted soil class maps obtained by these three prediction methods. The comparison was conducted in two study areas: Ammertal (Germany) and Raffelson (USA). For each of these two areas a detailed legacy soil class map is available. These soil class maps were used as references in a simulation study for the comparison. Results of both study areas show that on average FSCS outperforms CLHS and SRS for all three prediction methods. The difference in estimated medians of overall accuracy with CLHS and SRS was marginal. Moreover, the variation in overall accuracy among sample sets of the same size was considerably smaller for FSCS than that for CLHS. These results in the two study areas suggest that FSCS is a more effective sampling design.},

Disturbances, such as drainage and climate drying, act to lower peatland water table depths, consequently enhancing soil carbon release and subsidence rates. Here, we conduct a global meta-analysis to quantify the relationship among water table depth, carbon release and subsidence. We find that the water table decline stimulated heterotrophic, rather than autotrophic, soil respiration, which was associated with an increase in subsidence rate. This relationship held across different climate zones and land uses. We find that 81\% of the total annual soil respiration for all drained peatlands was attributable to tropical peatlands drained for agriculture and forestry and temperate peatlands drained for agriculture. Globally, we estimate that, drained peatlands release 645\,Mt\,C\,yr--1 (401--1025\,Mt\,C\,yr--1) through soil respiration, equivalent to approximately 5\% of global annual anthropogenic carbon emissions. Our findings highlight the importance of conserving pristine peatlands to help mitigate climate change.},

Many spatial CV methodologies have been proposed to address this by forcing models to extrapolate spatially when predicting the assessment set. However, to date there exists little guidance on which methods yield the most accurate estimates of model performance. We conducted simulations to compare model performance estimates produced by five common CV methods fit to spatially structured data. We found spatial CV approaches generally improved upon resubstitution and V-fold CV estimates, particularly when approaches which combined assessment sets of spatially conjunct observations with spatial exclusion buffers. To facilitate use of these techniques, we introduce the `spatialsample` package which provides tooling for performing spatial CV as part of the broader tidymodels modeling framework.},

  abstract = {Canopy height is a key driver of forest biodiversity and carbon cycling. Accurate estimates of canopy height are needed for assessing mechanisms relating to ecological patterns and processes of tree height limitations. At global scales forest canopy height patterns are largely controlled by climate, while local variation at fine scales is due to differences in disturbance history and local patterns in environmental conditions. The relative effect of local environmental drivers on canopy height is poorly understood partly due to gaps in data on canopy height and methods for examining limiting factors. Here, we used airborne laser scanning (ALS) data on vegetation structure of boreal forests to examine the effects of environmental factors on potential maximum forest canopy height.Relationships between maximum canopy height from ALS measures and environmental variables were examined to assess factors limiting tree height. Specifically, we used quantile regression at the 0.90 quantile to relate maximum canopy height with environmental characteristics of climate (i.e. mean annual temperature [MAT] and mean annual precipitation), terrain (i.e. slope) and depth-to-water (DTW) across a 33000 km2 multiple use boreal forest landscape in northeast Alberta, Canada.Maximum canopy height was positively associated with MAT, terrain slope and terrain-derived DTW, collectively explaining 33.2\% of the variation in heights. The strongest explanatory variable was DTW explaining 26\% of canopy height variation with peatland forests having naturally shorter maximum canopy heights, but also more sites currently at their maximum potential height. In contrast, the most productive forests (i.e. mesic to xeric upland forests) had the fewest sites at their potential maximum height, illustrating the effects of long-term forest management, wildfires and general anthropogenic footprints on reducing the extent and abundance of older, taller forest habitat in Alberta's boreal forest.},

Given the difficulty in modeling spatial dependence, especially in non-stationary cases, model-based prediction intervals are at risk of misspecification bias that can negatively affect their validity. Here we present a new approach for model-free nonparametric spatial prediction based on the conformal prediction machinery. Our key observation is that spatial data can be treated as exactly or approximately exchangeable in a wide range of settings. In particular, under an infill asymptotic regime, we prove that the response values are, in a certain sense, locally approximately exchangeable for a broad class of spatial processes, and we develop a local spatial conformal prediction algorithm that yields valid prediction intervals without strong model assumptions like stationarity. Numerical examples with both real and simulated data confirm that the proposed conformal prediction intervals are valid and generally more efficient than existing model-based procedures for large datasets across a range of non-stationary and non-Gaussian settings.},

  abstract = {Soil is a three-dimensional volume with property variability in all three dimensions. In Digital Soil Mapping (DSM), the variation of soil properties down a profile is usually harmonised by the use of the equal-area spline depth function approach. Soil observations at various depth intervals are harmonised to pre-determined depth intervals. To create maps of soil at the defined depth intervals, 2.5D model produces maps of individual depth intervals separately. Those maps can be reconstructed to produce a continuous depth function for each predicted location. More recently, several studies propose that soil property at any depth can be mapped using a model incorporating depth along with spatial covariates as predictor variables, creating a `3D' model. The aim of this study is to evaluate the proposition that soil properties can be predicted at any depth.This study compares the 2.5D model and 3D model in two areas. The first test is on a 1500~km2 area in Edgeroi, New South Wales (NSW), Australia, mapping soil organic carbon (SOC, \%), carbon storage (kg m-2), pH (H2O), clay content (\%), and cation exchange capacity (CEC, mg/kg) based on depth-interval observations. The second study area in the Lower Hunter Valley has SOC observations at every 2~cm increment from a 210~km2 area. 2.5D and 3D models were tested in both study areas using four machine learning techniques: Cubist regression tree, Quantile Regression Forest (QRF), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and 3D Generalised Additive Model (GAM). Results show that, in terms of R2 and RMSE, 2.5D and 3D models using different machine learning models produce comparable results on the validation of depth interval observations. The 3D tree-based models produce ``stepped'' prediction of properties with depth. Results on the Hunter Valley area with point observations show that the 3D model cannot replicate field point observations. 3D soil mapping on point depth observation has lower accuracy and larger uncertainty compared to the 2.5D model. For future DSM studies, 3D soil mapping with depth as a covariate requires caution with respect to the prediction method and the requirements of the results.},

However, remote sensors rarely make direct measurements of the soil property of interest. Instead, an empirical model is required to relate the remote sensing data to ground measurements of the property of interest. We discuss how a survey of ground measurements required to calibrate such a model can be optimized. We make reference to the mapping of peat depth within the Dartmoor National Park (UK) using radiometric potassium data from an airborne survey of the region (http://www.tellusgb.ac.uk/). We expand the standard linear mixed model to accommodate nonlinear relationships between radiometric potassium and peat depths. The attenuation of the radiometric signal is seen to increase with peat depth, but the depth is particularly uncertain when the radiometric signal is small. When a spatial simulated annealing algorithm is used to optimize the locations for a survey of peat depth measurements to minimize the errors in the maps of peat depth upon use of the radiometric data, the complete range of the radiometric data are sampled but ground measurements are particularly focussed where the radiometric signal is small. We see that an optimized survey of 30 ground measurements combined with the radiometric data lead to more accurate maps than can be achieved from interpolation of more than 200 peat depth measurements.},

  abstract = {Remote sensors provide high resolution data over large spatial extents that can potentially be used to map soil properties such as the concentration of organic carbon or its moisture content. The sensors rarely measure the property of interest directly but instead measure a related property. There is a need to make ground measurements of the property of interest to calibrate a model or relationship between the soil property and the sensor data. We develop a framework for optimizing the locations and number of ground measurements of a soil property for surveys incorporating sensor data. The data are used to estimate a linear mixed model of the property where the fixed effects are a flexible spline-based function of the sensor measurements. The framework is used to map peat depth across a portion of Dartmoor National Park using radiometric potassium data measurements from an airborne survey. The most accurate maps result from using a geostatistical predictor to combine the relationship with the sensor data and the spatial correlation amongst the peat depth measurements. The optimal sampling designs suggest that ground measurements should be focussed where peat depths are largest and most uncertain. When measurements are made at 25 optimally selected sites, predictions that do not utilise the sensor data have 20\% larger root mean square errors than those that do. For 200 ground measurements this benefit is 14\%. The maps produced using the sensor data and 25 ground measurements have smaller root mean square errors than those based only upon 200 ground measurements.},

  abstract = {Land-surface parameters derived from digital land surface models (DLSMs) (for example, slope, surface curvature, topographic position, topographic roughness, aspect, heat load index, and topographic moisture index) can serve as key predictor variables in a wide variety of mapping and modeling tasks relating to geomorphic processes, landform delineation, ecological and habitat characterization, and geohazard, soil, wetland, and general thematic mapping and modeling. However, selecting features from the large number of potential derivatives that may be predictive for a specific feature or process can be complicated, and existing literature may offer contradictory or incomplete guidance. The availability of multiple data sources and the need to define moving window shapes, sizes, and cell weightings further complicate selecting and optimizing the feature space. This review focuses on the calculation and use of DLSM parameters for empirical spatial predictive modeling applications, which rely on training data and explanatory variables to make predictions of landscape features and processes over a defined geographic extent. The target audience for this review is researchers and analysts undertaking predictive modeling tasks that make use of the most widely used terrain variables. To outline best practices and highlight future research needs, we review a range of land-surface parameters relating to steepness, local relief, rugosity, slope orientation, solar insolation, and moisture and characterize their relationship to geomorphic processes. We then discuss important considerations when selecting such parameters for predictive mapping and modeling tasks to assist analysts in answering two critical questions: What landscape conditions or processes does a given measure characterize? How might a particular metric relate to the phenomenon or features being mapped, modeled, or studied? We recommend the use of landscape- and problem-specific pilot studies to answer, to the extent possible, these questions for potential features of interest in a mapping or modeling task. We describe existing techniques to reduce the size of the feature space using feature selection and feature reduction methods, assess the importance or contribution of specific metrics, and parameterize moving windows or characterize the landscape at varying scales using alternative methods while highlighting strengths, drawbacks, and knowledge gaps for specific techniques. Recent developments, such as explainable machine learning and convolutional neural network (CNN)-based deep learning, may guide and/or minimize the need for feature space engineering and ease the use of DLSMs in predictive modeling tasks.},

We discuss the various methods that have been, or could be, used for fitting quantitative relationships between soil properties or classes and their `environment'. These include generalised linear models, classification and regression trees, neural networks, fuzzy systems and geostatistics. We also review the data layers that have been, or could be, used to describe the `environment'. Terrain attributes derived from digital elevation models, and spectral reflectance bands from satellite imagery, have been the most commonly used, but there is a large potential for new data layers. The generic framework, which we call the scorpan-SSPFe (soil spatial prediction function with spatially autocorrelated errors) method, is particularly relevant for those places where soil resource information is limited. It is based on the seven predictive scorpan factors, a generalisation of Jenny's five factors, namely: (1) s: soil, other or previously measured attributes of the soil at a point; (2) c: climate, climatic properties of the environment at a point; (3) o: organisms, including land cover and natural vegetation; (4) r: topography, including terrain attributes and classes; (5) p: parent material, including lithology; (6) a: age, the time factor; (7) n: space, spatial or geographic position. Interactions (*) between these factors are also considered. The scorpan-SSPFe method essentially involves the following steps: (i) Define soil attribute(s) of interest and decide resolution {$\rho$} and block size {$\beta$}.(ii) Assemble data layers to represent Q.(iii) Spatial decomposition or lagging of data layers.(iv) Sampling of assembled data (Q) to obtain sampling sites.(v) GPS field sampling and laboratory analysis to obtain soil class or property data.(vi) Fit quantitative relationships (observing Ockham's razor) with autocorrelated errors.(vii) Predict digital map.(viii) Field sampling and laboratory analysis for corroboration and quality testing.(ix) If necessary, simplify legend or decrease resolution by returning to (i) or improve map by returning to (v).

Machine learning algorithms are frequently used to learn from local field observations to make spatial predictions by estimating the value of the variable of interest in places where it has not been measured. However, the application of machine learning strategies for spatial mapping involves additional challenges compared to "non-spatial" prediction tasks that often originate from spatial autocorrelation and from training data that are not independent and identically distributed. In the past few years, we developed a number of methods to support the application of machine learning for spatial data which involves the development of suitable cross-validation strategies for performance assessment and model selection, spatial feature selection, and methods to assess the area of applicability of the trained models. The intention of the CAST package is to support the application of machine learning strategies for predictive mapping by implementing such methods and making them available for easy integration into modelling workflows. Here we introduce the CAST package and its core functionalities. At the case study of mapping plant species richness, we will go through the different steps of the modelling workflow and show how CAST can be used to support more reliable spatial predictions.},

However, the characteristics of spatial data, especially spatial autocorrelation, are widely ignored. We hypothesize that this is problematic and results in models that can reproduce training data but are unable to make spatial predictions beyond the locations of the training samples. We assume that not only spatial validation strategies but also spatial variable selection is essential for reliable spatial predictions. We introduce two case studies that use remote sensing to predict land cover and the leaf area index for the ``Marburg Open Forest'', an open research and education site of Marburg University, Germany. We use the machine learning algorithm Random Forests to train models using non-spatial and spatial cross-validation strategies to understand how spatial variable selection affects the predictions. Our findings confirm that spatial cross-validation is essential in preventing overoptimistic model performance. We further show that highly autocorrelated predictors (such as geolocation variables, e.g. latitude, longitude) can lead to considerable overfitting and result in models that can reproduce the training data but fail in making spatial predictions. The problem becomes apparent in the visual assessment of the spatial predictions that show clear artefacts that can be traced back to a misinterpretation of the spatially autocorrelated predictors by the algorithm. Spatial variable selection could automatically detect and remove such variables that lead to overfitting, resulting in reliable spatial prediction patterns and improved statistical spatial model performance. We conclude that in addition to spatial validation, a spatial variable selection must be considered in spatial prediction models of ecological data to produce reliable results.},

  abstract = {Machine learning algorithms have become very popular for spatial mapping of the environment due to their ability to fit nonlinear and complex relationships. However, this ability comes with the disadvantage that they can only be applied to new data if these are similar to the training data. Since spatial mapping requires predictions to new geographic space which in many cases goes along with new predictor properties, a method to assess the area to which a prediction model can be reliably applied is required. Here, we suggest a methodology that delineates the `area of applicability' (AOA) that we define as the area where we enabled the model to learn about relationships based on the training data, and where the estimated cross-validation performance holds. We first propose a `dissimilarity index' (DI) that is based on the minimum distance to the training data in the multidimensional predictor space, with predictors being weighted by their respective importance in the model. The AOA is then derived by applying a threshold which is the (outlier-removed) maximum DI of the training data derived via cross-validation. We further use the relationship between the DI and the cross-validation performance to map the estimated performance of predictions. We illustrate the approach in a simulated case study chosen to mimic ecological realities and test the credibility by using a large set of simulated data. The simulation studies showed that the prediction error within the AOA is comparable to the cross-validation error of the trained model, while the cross-validation error does not apply outside the AOA. This applies to models being trained with randomly distributed training data, as well as when training data are clustered in space and where spatial cross-validation is applied. Using the relationship between DI and cross-validation performance showed potential to limit predictions to the area where a user-defined performance applies. We suggest to add the AOA computation to the modeller's standard toolkit and to present predictions for the AOA only. We further suggest to report a map of DI-dependent performance estimates alongside prediction maps and complementary to (cross-)validation performance measures and the common uncertainty estimates.},

  abstract = {Several spatial and non-spatial Cross-Validation (CV) methods have been used to perform map validation when additional sampling for validation purposes is not possible, yet it is unclear in which situations one CV method might be preferred over the other. Three factors have been identified as determinants of the performance of CV methods for map validation: the prediction area (geographical interpolation vs. extrapolation), the sampling pattern and the landscape spatial autocorrelation. In this study, we propose a new CV strategy that takes the geographical prediction space into account, and test how the new method compares with other established CV methods under different configurations of these three factors. We propose a variation of Leave-One-Out (LOO) CV for map validation, called Nearest Neighbour Distance Matching (NNDM) LOO CV, in which the nearest neighbour distance distribution function between the test and training data during the CV process is matched to the nearest neighbour distance distribution function between the target prediction and training points. Using random forest as a machine learning algorithm, we then examine the suitability of NNDM LOO CV as well as the established LOO (non-spatial) and buffered-LOO (bLOO, spatial) CV methods in two simulations with varying prediction areas, landscape autocorrelation and sampling distributions. LOO CV provided good map accuracy estimates in landscapes with short autocorrelation ranges, or when estimating geographical interpolation map accuracy with randomly distributed samples. bLOO CV yielded realistic error estimates when estimating map accuracy in new prediction areas, but generally overestimated geographical interpolation errors. NNDM LOO CV returned reliable estimates in all scenarios we considered. While LOO and bLOO CV provided reliable map accuracy estimates only in certain situations, our newly proposed NNDM LOO CV method returned robust estimates and generalised to LOO and bLOO CV whenever these methods were the most appropriate approach. Our work recognises the necessity of considering the geographical prediction space when designing CV-based methods for map validation.},

  abstract = {Applying a data mining tool used regularly in digital soil mapping, this research focuses on the optimal inclusion of predictors for soil--landscape modeling by utilizing as wide of a pool of variables as possible. Predictor variables for digital soil mapping are often chosen on the basis of data availability and the researcher's expert knowledge. Predictor variables commonly overlooked include alternative analysis scales for land-surface derivatives and additional remote sensing products. For this study, a pool of 412 potential predictors was assembled, which included qualitative location classes, elevation, land-surface derivatives (with a wide range of analysis scales), hydrologic indicators, as well as proximal and remote sensing (from multiple sources with a variety of resolutions). Subsets of the full pool were also examined for comparison. The performance for the models built from the different starting predictor pools was analyzed for seven target variables. Results suggest that models with limited predictor pools can substitute other predictors to compensate for the missing variables. However, a better performing model was always found by considering predictor variables at multiple scales. Compared with baseline subsets with the most commonly used predictors for digital soil mapping at a single scale, the use of multi-scale predictor variables produced an improvement in model performance ranging from negligible to a 70\% increase in the adjusted R2. Although the scale effect of the modifiable area unit problem is generally well known, this study suggests digital soil mapping efforts would be enhanced by the greater consideration of predictor variables at multiple analysis scales.},

Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) is a stratified random procedure that provides an efficient way of sampling variables from their multivariate distributions. It provides a full coverage of the range of each variable by maximally stratifying the marginal distribution. For conditioned Latin hypercube sampling (cLHS) the problem is: given N sites with ancillary variables (X), select x a sub-sample of size n (n{$\NestedLessLess$}N) in order that x forms a Latin hypercube, or the multivariate distribution of X is maximally stratified. This paper presents the cLHS method with a search algorithm based on heuristic rules combined with an annealing schedule. The method is illustrated with a simple 3-D example and an application in digital soil mapping of part of the Hunter Valley of New South Wales, Australia. Comparison is made with other methods: random sampling, and equal spatial strata. The results show that the cLHS is the most effective way to replicate the distribution of the variables.},

  abstract = {Peatlands offer a series of ecosystem services including carbon storage, biomass production, and climate regulation. Climate change and rapid land use change are degrading peatlands, liberating their stored carbon (C) into the atmosphere. To conserve peatlands and help in realising the Paris Agreement, we need to understand their extent, status, and C stocks. However, current peatland knowledge is vague---estimates of global peatland extent ranges from 1 to 4.6\,million km2, and C stock estimates vary between 113 and 612 Pg (or billion tonne C). This uncertainty mostly stems from the coarse spatial scale of global soil maps. In addition, most global peatland estimates are based on rough country inventories and reports that use outdated data. This review shows that digital mapping using field observations combined with remotely-sensed images and statistical models is an avenue to more accurately map peatlands and decrease this knowledge gap. We describe peat mapping experiences from 12 countries or regions and review 90 recent studies on peatland mapping. We found that interest in mapping peat information derived from satellite imageries and other digital mapping technologies is growing. Many studies have delineated peat extent using land cover from remote sensing, ecology, and environmental field studies, but rarely perform validation, and calculating the uncertainty of prediction is rare. This paper then reviews various proximal and remote sensing techniques that can be used to map peatlands. These include geophysical measurements (electromagnetic induction, resistivity measurement, and gamma radiometrics), radar sensing (SRTM, SAR), and optical images (Visible and Infrared). Peatland is better mapped when using more than one covariate, such as optical and radar products using nonlinear machine learning algorithms. The proliferation of satellite data available in an open-access format, availability of machine learning algorithms in an open-source computing environment, and high-performance computing facilities could enhance the way peatlands are mapped. Digital soil mapping allows us to map peat in a cost-effective, objective, and accurate manner. Securing peatlands for the future, and abating their contribution to atmospheric C levels, means digitally mapping them now.},

  abstract = {Peatlands cover only 3--4\% of the Earth's surface, but they store nearly 30\% of global soil carbon stock. This significant carbon store is under threat as peatlands continue to be degraded at alarming rates around the world. It has prompted countries worldwide to establish regulations to conserve and reduce emissions from this carbon rich ecosystem. For example, the EU has implemented new rules that mandate sustainable management of peatlands, critical to reaching the goal of carbon neutrality by 2050. However, a lack of information on the extent and condition of peatlands has hindered the development of national policies and restoration efforts. This paper reviews the current state of knowledge on mapping and monitoring peatlands from field sites to the globe and identifies areas where further research is needed. It presents an overview of the different methodologies used to map peatlands in nine countries, which vary in definition of peat soil and peatland, mapping coverage, and mapping detail. Whereas mapping peatlands across the world with only one approach is hardly possible, the paper highlights the need for more consistent approaches within regions having comparable peatland types and climates to inform their protection and urgent restoration. The review further summarises various approaches used for monitoring peatland conditions and functions. These include monitoring at the plot scale for degree of humification and stoichiometric ratio, and proximal sensing such as gamma radiometrics and electromagnetic induction at the field to landscape scale for mapping~peat thickness and identifying~hotspots for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Remote sensing techniques with passive and active sensors at regional to national scale can~help in monitoring subsidence rate, water table, peat moisture, landslides, and GHG emissions. Although the use of water table depth as a proxy for interannual GHG emissions from peatlands has been well established, there is no single remote sensing method or data product yet that has been verified beyond local or regional scales. Broader land-use change and fire monitoring at a global scale may further assist national GHG inventory reporting. Monitoring of peatland conditions to evaluate the success of individual restoration schemes still requires field work to assess local proxies combined with remote sensing and modeling. Long-term monitoring is necessary to draw valid conclusions on revegetation outcomes and associated GHG emissions in rewetted peatlands, as their dynamics are not fully understood at the~site level. Monitoring vegetation development and hydrology of restored peatlands is needed as a proxy to assess the return of water and changes in nutrient cycling and biodiversity.},

  abstract = {Machine learning (ML) applications in soil science have significantly increased over the past two decades, reflecting a growing trend towards data-driven research addressing soil security. This extensive application has mainly focused on enhancing predictions of soil properties, particularly soil organic carbon, and improving the accuracy of digital soil mapping (DSM). Despite these advancements, the application of ML in soil science faces challenges related to data scarcity and the interpretability of ML models. There is a need for a shift towards Soil Science-Informed ML (SoilML) models that use the power of ML but also incorporate soil science knowledge in the training process to make predictions more reliable and generalisable. This paper proposes methodologies for embedding ML models with soil science knowledge to overcome current limitations. Incorporating soil science knowledge into ML models involves using observational priors to enhance training datasets, designing model structures which reflect soil science principles, and supervising model training with soil science-informed loss functions. The informed loss functions include observational constraints, coherency rules such as regularisation to avoid overfitting, and prior or soil-knowledge constraints that incorporate existing information about the parameters or outputs. By way of illustration, we present examples from four fields: digital soil mapping, soil spectroscopy, pedotransfer functions, and dynamic soil property models. We discuss the potential to integrate process-based models for improved prediction, the use of physics-informed neural networks, limitations, and the issue of overparametrisation. These approaches improve the relevance of ML predictions in soil science and enhance the models' ability to generalise across different scenarios while maintaining soil science principles, transparency and reliability.},

  abstract = {Effective environmental management and contamination remediation require accurate spatial distributions and predictions of potentially toxic elements (PTEs) in the soil. However, no single method has been developed to predict soil PTE accurately. This study evaluated the advanced geostatistical method of empirical Bayesian kriging regression prediction (EBKRP), machine learning algorithm of random forest (RF), and hybridized model (RF-EBKRP) to predict and map PTEs content in greenspace soils. As identified by RF, soil organic carbon, organic matter, total (nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium), topographic features, and urban functional types were used as significant covariates to improve the prediction accuracy of PTEs in soil. The model prediction performance was evaluated using the root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and coefficient of determination (R2). Results showed that RF performed much better than EBKRP in predicting soil PTEs, with lower prediction errors and a higher R2. The RMSE, MAPE, and R2 values for the RF model were 0.25--85.32~mg/kg, 3.86--25.40\%, and 0.77--0.90, respectively, while the values for the EBKRP method were 0.51--99.03~mg/kg, 5.42--32.13\%, and 0.40--0.66. Moreover, the RF-EBKRP method produced more accurate spatial predictions and distributions of PTEs than the individual models, with R2 improvements of 122.5\% for EBKRP and 15.58\% for RF. The better performances of RF-EBKRP are due to its incorporation of various covariates and its ability to handle complex nonlinear relationships between soil PTEs and covariates. In the end, a hybrid RF-EBKRP method is a promising approach to improving the spatial distribution map of soil PTEs.},

  abstract = {This article reviews the use of optical and microwave remote sensing data for soil and terrain mapping with emphasis on applications at regional and coarser scales. Remote sensing is expected to offer possibilities for improving incomplete spatial and thematic coverage of current regional and global soil databases. Traditionally, remotely sensed imagery have been used to support segmentation of the landscape into rather homogeneous soil--landscape units for which soil composition can be established by sampling. Soil properties have also been inferred from optical and microwave data using physically-based and empirical methods. Used as a secondary data source, remotely sensed imagery may support spatial interpolation of sparsely sampled soil property data. Soil properties that have been measured using remote or proximal sensing approaches include mineralogy, texture, soil iron, soil moisture, soil organic carbon, soil salinity and carbonate content. In sparsely vegetated areas, successful use of space borne, airborne, and in situ measurements using optical, passive and active microwave instruments has been reported. On the other hand, in densely vegetated areas, soil data acquisition typically relied on indirect retrievals using soil indicators, such as plant functional groups, productivity changes, and Ellenberg indicator values. Several forms of kriging, classification and regression tree analyses have been used jointly with remotely sensed data to predict soil properties at unvisited locations aiming at obtaining continuous area coverage. We expect that remotely sensed data from existing platforms and planned missions can provide an important data source supporting digital soil mapping. Yet, most studies so far have been performed on a local scale and only few on regional or smaller map scale. Although progress has been made, current methods and techniques still bear potential to further explore the full range of spectral, spatial and temporal properties of existing data sources. For example, space borne spectroscopy has been of limited use in retrieving soil data when compared to laboratory or field spectroscopy. To date, there is no coherent methodology established, where approaches of spatial segmentation, measurements of soil properties and interpolation using remotely sensed data are integrated in a holistic fashion to achieve complete area coverage. Such approaches will enhance the perspectives of using remotely sensed data for digital soil mapping.},

Effective management of wetlands requires accurate and comprehensive spatial information on location, size, classification, and connectivity in the landscape. Using a GIS, two provincial wetland maps were compared with regard to their areal correspondence across different ecoregions of New Brunswick. The first consisted of discrete wetland units (vector data) derived from aerial photo interpretation. The second consisted of wet areas modeled by a newly developed depth-to-water index with continuous coverage across the landscape (raster data). This index was derived from a digital elevation model and hydrographic data. The relative advantages and disadvantages of the two approaches were assessed. The two maps were generally consistent with most discrete wetland areas (51\%--67\%) embedded in the 0-- 10 cm depth-to-water class, verifying the continuous modeling approach. The continuous model identified a larger wetland area. Much of this additional area consisted of riparian zones and numerous small wetlands ({$<$} 1 ha) that were not captured by aerial photo interpretation. Unlike the discrete map, the continuous model showed the hydrological connectivity of wetlands across the landscape. Both approaches revealed that topography was a major control on wetland distribution between ecoregions, with more wetland in ecoregions with flatter topography.},

This index was derived from a LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) derived digital elevation model (DEM), with at least 1 ground return per m2. The resulting DTW pattern was set to be zero along all DEM-derived flow channels, each with a 4ha flow-initiation threshold. Soil type (luvisol, gleysol, mesisol), drainage type (very poor to excessive), vegetation type (hydric to xeric) and forest floor depth were determined along hillslope transects. These determinations conformed more closely to the DEM-derived log10(DTW) variations (R2{$>$}60\%) than to the corresponding variations of the widely used topographic wetness index (TWI) (R2{$<$}25\%). Setting log10(DTW) thresholds to represent the wet to moist to dry transitions between vegetation, drainage and soil type enabled a high-resolution mapping of these types across the study area. Also determined were soil moisture content, coarse fragment and soil particle composition (sand, silt, clay), pH, total C, N, S, P, Ca, Mg, K, Fe, Al, Mn, Zn, and available Ca, Mg, K, P and NH4, by soil layer type and depth. Most of these variables were also more correlated with log10(DTW) than with TWI, with and without soil layer depth as an additional regression variable. These variables are, therefore, subject to topographic controls to at least some extent, and can be modelled and mapped accordingly, as illustrated for soil moisture, forest floor depth and pH across the study area, from ridge tops to depressions. Further examinations revealed that the DEM-produced DTW and TWI patterns complemented one another, with DTW delineating soils in relation to local water-table influences, and with TWI delineating where the water would flow and accumulate.},

A widely used topographic index, the soil wetness index (SWI), was compared with a new algorithm that produces a cartographic depth-to-water (DTW) index based on distance to surface water and slope. Both models reflect the tendency for soil to be saturated. A 1 m resolution Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) DEM and a 10 m conventional photogrammetric DEM were used and results were compared with field-mapped wet soil areas for a 193 ha watershed in Alberta, Canada, for verification. The DTW model was closer to field-mapped conditions. Values of Kmatch90 (areal correspondence, smaller values indicating better performance) were 7.8\% and 12.3\% for the LiDAR and conventional DEM DTW models, respectively, and 88.5\% and 86.7\% for the SWI models. The two indices were poorly correlated spatially. Both DEMs were found to be useful for modelling soil moisture conditions using the DTW model, but the LiDAR DEM produced the better results. All major wet areas and flow connectivity were reproduced and a threshold value of 1.5 m DTW accounted for 71\% of the observed wet areas. The poor performance of the SWI model is probably because of its over-dependence on flow accumulation. Incorporation of a flow accumulation algorithm that replicates the effects of dispersed flow showed some improvement in the SWI model for the conventional DEM but it still failed to replicate the full areal extent of wet areas. Local downslope topography and hydrologic conditions seemed to be more important in determining soil moisture conditions than is taken account of by the SWI. The DTW model has potential for application in distributed hydrologic modelling, precision forestry and agriculture and implementation of environmental soil management practices.},

  abstract = {Topographic data are increasingly important to environmental models as fine-scale resolution, wide coverage data sets become available. Scale is an important consideration for predictive model quality. Recent advances in multiscale terrain analysis led to scaling techniques that allow the scale at which a topographic parameter is represented to vary spatially. This research compared predictive soil model performance across feature sets generated with different scaling strategies; including multiple heterogeneous strategies, common feature selection algorithms applied to homogeneously scaled data, and unscaled data. Model performance was assessed for accuracy and uncertainty. The results showed that unscaled data performed worse in all circumstances compared to multiscale feature sets. Overall, heterogeneous and homogeneous feature sets did not differ substantially in accuracy, prediction uncertainty, or error. However, one scaling strategy exploited the flexibility of heterogeneous scaling to consistently perform better than other feature sets for most soil properties in terms of accuracy, and consistently ranked among the least uncertain and least error prone (up to a 0.080 increase in accuracy with a corresponding 0.017 decrease in prediction uncertainty and 0.011 decrease in error relative to the second best method, in the case of the proportion of clay modelled at 5--15~cm depth). This was achieved by decoupling the definition of process scales from analytical parameterization, allowing the optimization to occur within broadly defined process scales. This research demonstrates how to exploit heterogeneous scaling of topographic attributes to improve model performance.},

  abstract = {Background: Random forests (RF) have been increasingly used in applications such as genome-wide association and microarray studies where predictor correlation is frequently observed. Recent works on permutation-based variable importance measures (VIMs) used in RF have come to apparently contradictory conclusions. We present an extended simulation study to synthesize results. Results: In the case when both predictor correlation was present and predictors were associated with the outcome (HA), the unconditional RF VIM attributed a higher share of importance to correlated predictors, while under the null hypothesis that no predictors are associated with the outcome (H0) the unconditional RF VIM was unbiased. Conditional VIMs showed a decrease in VIM values for correlated predictors versus the unconditional VIMs under HA and was unbiased under H0. Scaled VIMs were clearly biased under HA and H0. Conclusions: Unconditional unscaled VIMs are a computationally tractable choice for large datasets and are unbiased under the null hypothesis. Whether the observed increased VIMs for correlated predictors may be considered a ``bias'' - because they do not directly reflect the coefficients in the generating model - or if it is a beneficial attribute of these VIMs is dependent on the application. For example, in genetic association studies, where correlation between markers may help to localize the functionally relevant variant, the increased importance of correlated predictors may be an advantage. On the other hand, we show examples where this increased importance may result in spurious signals.},

  abstract = {Abstract. The spatial assessment of soil functions requires maps of basic soil properties. Unfortunately, these are either missing for many regions or are not available at the desired spatial resolution or down to the required soil depth. The field-based generation of large soil datasets and conventional soil maps remains costly. Meanwhile, legacy soil data and comprehensive sets of spatial environmental data are available for many regions.Digital soil mapping (DSM) approaches relating soil data (responses) to environmental data (covariates) face the challenge of building statistical models from large sets of covariates originating, for example, from airborne imaging spectroscopy or multi-scale terrain analysis. We evaluated six approaches for DSM in three study regions in Switzerland (Berne, Greifensee, ZH forest) by mapping the effective soil depth available to plants (SD), pH, soil organic matter (SOM), effective cation exchange capacity (ECEC), clay, silt, gravel content and fine fraction bulk density for four soil depths (totalling 48 responses). Models were built from 300--500~environmental covariates by selecting linear models through (1)~grouped lasso and (2)~an ad hoc stepwise procedure for robust external-drift kriging (georob). For (3)~geoadditive models we selected penalized smoothing spline terms by component-wise gradient boosting (geoGAM). We further used two tree-based methods: (4)~boosted regression trees (BRTs) and (5)~random forest (RF). Lastly, we computed (6)~weighted model averages (MAs) from the predictions obtained from methods~1--5.Lasso, georob and geoGAM successfully selected strongly reduced sets of covariates (subsets of 3--6\,\% of all covariates). Differences in predictive performance, tested on independent validation data, were mostly small and did not reveal a single best method for 48~responses. Nevertheless, RF was often the best among methods 1--5 (28 of 48~responses), but was outcompeted by MA for 14 of these 28~responses. RF tended to over-fit the data. The performance of BRT was slightly worse than RF. GeoGAM performed poorly on some responses and was the best only for 7 of 48~responses. The prediction accuracy of lasso was intermediate. All models generally had small bias. Only the computationally very efficient lasso had slightly larger bias because it tended to under-fit the data. Summarizing, although differences were small, the frequencies of the best and worst performance clearly favoured RF if a single method is applied and MA if multiple prediction models can be developed.},

Kinn kommune har eit landareal p{\aa} 811 km{$^2$}. Av dette er om lag 317 km{$^2$} (39 \%) skogkledd. L{\aa}gproduktiv kystfuruskog, hovudsakleg r{\o}sslyng-blokkeb{\ae}rskog, utgjer det meste av skogarealet. Myr dekkjer om lag 22 km{$^2$} (2,7 \%). I tillegg kjem skogkledd myr og myr som er drenert og dyrka opp, eller brukt til skogreising, totalt om lag 28 km{$^2$} (3,5 \%). Flatmyr, bakkemyr og planmyr er dei vanlegaste myrtypane, medan nedb{\o}rmyr og fattig jordvassmyr er dei vanlegaste vegetasjonstypane. Det finst ingen arealoppg{\aa}ver over semi-naturleg mark i kommunen, men naturtypen utgjer truleg fleire titals km{$^2$}, og arealmessig utgjer kystlynghei st{\o}rsteparten. Naturleg opne omr{\aa}de under skoggrensa (alts{\aa} areal som ikkje er jordbruksmark, skog, myr eller semi-naturleg mark) utgjer noko meir, men heller ikkje her fins det gode tal. Om lag 14,5 km{$^2$} (1,8 \%) av landarealet er jordbruksmark, av dette er 4,1 km{$^2$} (0,5 \%) overflatedyrka. Estimering av mengda karbon i dei ulike terrestriske naturtypane er i stor grad basert p{\aa} modellerte data eller ekspertvurderingar. Mengda informasjon varierer sterkt mellom hovud{\o}kosystema. Mest dokumentasjon finn ein for skog der data fr{\aa} Landskogstakseringa dannar grunnlaget, men sj{\o}lv for skog er ikkje datatettleiken h{\o}g nok til {\aa} gi n{\o}yaktige estimat p{\aa} karboninnhaldet p{\aa} kommuneniv{\aa}. I tillegg til bruk av eksisterande data vart det i august 2021 gjennomf{\o}rt eigne feltunders{\o}kingar med m{\aa}ling av jordsmonndjupne og biomasse i ni skog- og fire myrlokalitetar. Hovudform{\aa}let med dette var {\aa} finne ut om dei eksisterande, generaliserte eller modellerte dataene samsvarer med konkrete unders{\o}kingar i hovudnaturtypar som dekkjer stort areal (skog) eller har stort potensiale for lagring av karbon (myr). Unders{\o}kingane vart gjennomf{\o}rte p{\aa} Svan{\o}y som har store areal med dei vanlegaste skogstypane i kommunen og ulike myrtypar innan eit avgrensa areal. {\O}ya ligg dessutan litt inn fr{\aa} kysten slik at den representerer eit gjennomsnitt av kommunen med omsyn p{\aa} klimatilh{\o}ve. I tillegg vart det gjennomf{\o}rt nokre unders{\o}kingar av h{\o}gareliggande bakkemyrer lengst aust i kommunen. Basert p{\aa} eksisterande dokumentasjon og v{\aa}re eigne unders{\o}kingar estimerer vi den potensielle karbonmengda i skog til {\aa} variere fr{\aa} 12 kg/m{$^2$} i hogstflater til 47,5 kg/m{$^2$} i eldre granplantefelt. Hovuddelen av skogarealet har ei potensiell karbonmengd p{\aa} rundt 20 kg/m{$^2$} (snitt 20,1, median 19,4). Av dette utgjer karbonmengda under bakken i snitt rundt 16,5 kg/m{$^2$} (ca. 80 \%). Karbonmengda i myr varierer sterkt og her er djupna p{\aa} torva og kor omdanna torva er, avgjerande. Sterkt omdanna torv vil ha ein h{\o}gare tettleik og ei h{\o}gare volumvekt, og dermed h{\o}gare karboninnhald enn lite omdanna torv. V{\aa}re unders{\o}kingar i Kinn syner at karboninnhald per m{$^2$} for torvjord ligg mellom 35-250 kg C eller meir, og ein kan temmeleg sikkert rekne med eit snitt p{\aa} 60 kg C/m{$^2$} for 1 m djup torv (1 m{$^3$} med torv). For djupare myrer, t.d. 2 m djupe i snitt, vil karbonmengda ligge p{\aa} 90-140 kg/m{$^2$} avhengig av volumvekta Det vart ikkje gjort unders{\o}kingar av karboninnhald i semi-naturleg mark i Kinn, men v{\aa}re unders{\o}kingar av jord i dei skrinnaste r{\o}sslyng-blokkeb{\ae}rfuruskogane kan samanliknast med det ein vil finne i jordsmonnet i kystlynghei. Dersom vi legg til grunn at 80-90 \% av karbonet ligg i jordsmonnet vil det i s{\aa} fall gi ei karbonmengd p{\aa} 6-7 kg/m{$^2$}. P{\aa} bakgrunn desse unders{\o}kingane og ein gjennomgang av litteraturen estimerer vl karbonmengda i kystlynghei i Kinn til mellom 6 og 20 kg/m{$^2$}, men det er ikkje datagrunnlag for {\aa} differensiere karbonmengda mellom ulike areal av kystlynghei. Ut fr{\aa} tilgjengeleg dokumentasjon er det grunn til {\aa} tru at karbonmengda i semi-naturleg eng ligg om lag p{\aa} same niv{\aa} som kystlynghei eller litt h{\o}gare. Basert p{\aa} estimata over potensiell karbonmengd for ulike naturtypar er det utarbeidd eit kartdatasett som vil gi ein peikepinn p{\aa} mengda karbon lagra i ulike areal av Kinn kommune. Til slutt i rapporten blir det gitt ei oversikt over ulike sider ved restaurering av myr for {\aa} f{\aa} ned utslepp av CO2, og kva prinsipp som ligg til grunn for {\aa} lukkast med restaureringa. Det blir nemnt nokre d{\o}me p{\aa} potensielle lokalitetar i kommunen som kan eigne seg for restaurering},

  abstract = {Peat soils are high in soil organic matter (SOM) and are recognised stores of carbon. Knowledge of the spatial distribution of peat soils is becoming the focus of many studies and is related closely to peatland mapping. Accurate maps of peat soils have many applications of international importance e.g., gaseous emission inventory reporting or soil organic carbon stock accounting. Traditional mapping methods include in-situ soil auger sampling or peat probing (for depth) while modern methods also incorporate satellite data (optical and radar). However, both methods have limitations. Traditional sampling often omits boundaries and transition zones between peat and mineral soils, while satellite data only measure the surface and may not be able to penetrate landcover, potentially omitting areas of peat under, for example, grassland or forestry. Radiometrics is a measurement of naturally occurring gamma radiation. Peat soils attenuate this radiation through high soil moisture content. For the present study in Ireland, the supervised classification of gridded airborne radiometric data, acquired over multiple years, is performed using neural network pattern recognition to identify areas of peat and non-peat soils. Classification confidence values are used to identify the transition zone between these soil types, providing a simplified visualisation of this transition. Validation is performed using Loss on Ignition (LOI \%) point data and several different (blanket bog, raised bog, transition zone) sites in Ireland, showing classified data can detect the presence of peat soils from broad to local scales. Airborne geophysical methods, in particular airborne radiometrics, can bridge the gap between the accuracy of point measurement and the spatial coverage of satellite data to identify peat soils by providing uniform data and objective analysis. The resulting map is a step towards understanding the true spatial distribution of peat soils in Ireland, including transition zones.},

  abstract = {Peatlands account for approx. 4.23 million km2 of the land surface of Earth and between 5\,\% and 20\,\% of the global soil carbon stock, however much uncertainty exists. The release of carbon from modified peatlands is significant and affects the global carbon balance. The importance of conservation and rehabilitation of peatlands is clear. Global estimates currently use national scale mapping strategies that vary depending on available resources and national interest. The most up-to-date methods rely on satellite remote sensing data, which detect peat based on a multiband spectral signature, or reflected radar backscatter. However, satellite data may not be capable of detecting peat under landcover such as pasture or forest. Airborne geophysical surveys provide relevant subsurface information to update or redefine peatland extent maps at a national scale. Radiometric surveys, which measure the naturally occurring geologically sourced potassium, uranium, and thorium, offer the largest potential. Modelling of gamma ray attenuation shows that peat has a distinctive attenuation signature, due to its low bulk density, when considering all recorded radiometric data. This study exploits this signature by combining airborne radiometric data in a machine learning framework and training an artificial neural network to detect those data which have been acquired over previously mapped peatlands. A {$\sim$}95\,\% predictability is achieved. The trained neural network can be then used to predict the extent of all peatlands within a region, including forested and agriculturally modified peatlands, and an updated peatland map can be produced. This methodology has implications for global carbon stock assessment and rehabilitation projects where similar datasets exist or are planned, by updating the extent and boundary positions of current peatlands and uncovering previously unknown peatlands under forestry or grasslands.},

  abstract = {Peatlands are important sites of ecosystem services, particularly as soil carbon stores, and are recognised in many international climate strategies. However, drained peatlands, which have been modified for industrial extraction or agriculture, are responsible for carbon emission. Peatland restoration aims to return these degraded sites to a natural state. Multiple means of remotely monitoring the success of peat restoration are available, ranging from space-based satellite measurements (optical and radar) to airborne geophysical measurements (electro-magnetic and radiometric). This paper integrates multi-band, spatially coincident, remotely sensed data into a single framework, resulting in a comprehensive interpretation of intra-peatland variation of key restoration indicators. It uses a semi-automatic, data driven approach with unsupervised neural network machine learning clustering. A Multi-Cluster Average Standard Deviation metric is introduced which can determine the appropriate number of clusters for any dataset. The method was applied to a site in Ireland, representative of degraded peatlands, where optical satellite and airborne radiometric geophysical measurements were combined. The method was successful at determining the appropriate number of clusters for single and combined datasets, and the resulting cluster signatures provided visually compelling representations of the intra-peatland variation. This resulted in a comprehensive interpretation of intra-peatland variation of several key peatland restoration indicators, namely surface vegetation levels and soil moisture to~{$\sim~$}60~cm of the peat surface. The study provides a framework for high spatial and temporal resolution monitoring of peatland restoration using future drone-based platforms.},

We used data from 125 plots across five locations in the boreal forest of Alberta, Canada, to evaluate the following: the relationships between soil attributes and DTW; the optimal flow initiation area; and models to map the spatial variation of soil properties. Soil moisture regime (SMR), drainage class, and depth-to-mottles were strongly related with DTW, whereas soil nutrient regime, organic matter thickness, soil texture, and coarse fragment content exhibited weak and inconsistent relationships with DTW. A flow initiation area of 2 ha yielded the best representation for SMR, drainage class, and depth-to-mottles. DTW, flow accumulation (FA) and local slope were combined in a linear model to estimate and map SMR, whereas only DTW and FA were used to model drainage and depth-to-mottles. These results suggest that the DTW index can capture soil properties closely influenced by the water table but cannot characterize site and soil factors, which are also determined by parent material, climate, and vegetation.},

We describe a CNN model that takes inputs as images of covariates and explores spatial contextual information by finding non-linear local spatial relationships of neighbouring pixels. Unique features of the proposed model include input represented as a 3-D stack of images, data augmentation to reduce overfitting, and the simultaneous prediction of multiple outputs. Using a soil mapping example in Chile, the CNN model was trained to simultaneously predict soil organic carbon at multiples depths across the country. The results showed that, in this study, the CNN model reduced the error by 30\,\% compared with conventional techniques that only used point information of covariates. In the example of country-wide mapping at 100\,m resolution, the neighbourhood size from 3~to 9~pixels is more effective than at a point location and larger neighbourhood sizes. In addition, the CNN model produces less prediction uncertainty and it is able to predict soil carbon at deeper soil layers more accurately. Because the CNN model takes the covariate represented as images, it offers a simple and effective framework for future DSM models.},

  abstract = {Estimates of peat depth are required to inform understanding of peatland development, functioning, and ecosystem services such as carbon storage. However, there is a considerable lack of peat depth data at local, national, and global scales. Recent studies have attempted to address this knowledge deficit by using manual probing and ground-penetrating radar (GPR) to estimate depth. Despite increasing application, little consideration has been given to the accuracy of either of these techniques. This study examines the accuracy of probing and GPR for measuring peat depth. Corresponding GPR and probing surveys were carried out at a catchment scale in a blanket peatland. GPR depth estimations, calibrated using common midpoint (CMP) surveys, were found to be on average 35\% greater than probe measurements. The source of disagreement was found to be predominantly caused by depth probes becoming obstructed by artifacts within the peat body, although occasionally probing rods also penetrated sediments underlying the peat. Using the Complex Refractive Index Model, it was found that applying a single velocity of 0.036 m ns-1 across a single site may also result in -8 to +17\% error in estimation of peat depth due to spatial variability in water content and porosity. It is suggested that GPR calibrated at each site using CMP surveys may provide a more accurate method for measuring peat depth. Key Points Peat depths measured concurrently using GPR and manual probing disagree Error caused by probes being obstructed or extending into underlying sediments GPR surveys calibrated using CMP are most reliable for measuring depth {\copyright}2014.

  abstract = {Inventories of peat volume and carbon storage often include general values for peat depth, but more spatially explicit and accurate estimates are required if carbon management strategies are to be developed at scales appropriate for the management. This article presents a methodology for estimating peat depth for large blanket peat areas using field sampling and GIS modelling to map peat depth on Dartmoor in south-west England. The study area was divided into carbon unit areas (CUAs) based on soil and vegetation. Approximately 1000 peat depth measurements were taken, each consisting of a mean (n = 5) from depths within a 32 m2 area. Sampling points were stratified according to CUA area and proportional extent of slope and elevation classes. Regression analyses were used to determine the relationships between slope, elevation and peat depth within each CUA. The strongest relationship was for blanket peat (r2 = 0.53), with weaker ones for areas where peat was shallow and depth was less variable. A digital elevation model was used in a GIS to model peat depths for the whole of Dartmoor. Results were tested against a data set of 200 peat depths on a 250 m grid covering 1325 ha. We conclude that peat depth can be modelled using easily available topographic data combined with well-designed field sampling over larger spatial scales. The approach can result in accurate mapping of peat depth and carbon storage for blanket peatlands in the United Kingdom and perhaps also elsewhere.},

In this study, we evaluated the uncertainty in calculations of peat volume using high-resolution data to resolve the three-dimensional structure of a peat basin based on both direct (push probes) and indirect geophysical (ground-penetrating radar) measurements. We compared volumetric estimates from both approaches, accounting for potential sources of error, with values from the literature. Approximate uncertainty of 14 to 23\% was observed in the basin volume, and the total uncertainty roughly doubled when incorporating peat properties to derive the estimated C pool. Uncertainties in final C stock values are based on the uncertainty of the basin volumes and the variability in the peat properties and range between 31 and 38\%. The results indicate that the well-established ground-penetrating radar technique that is scalable to larger peatlands can be used to obtain estimates of peat basin volumes at uncertainty levels similar to those for invasive direct probe surveys. This investigation demonstrated that ground-penetrating radar can quantify peat basin volumes at uniquely high spatial resolution without the need for extensive and invasive direct probing.},

  abstract = {Accurate data on peat extent and thickness is essential for managing drained peatlands and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Machine learning-based digital soil mapping offers an effective approach for large-scale peat occurrence prediction. In this study, we present a workflow for producing peat occurrence maps for the whole of Finland. For this, we used random forest classification to map areas with peat thicknesses of~{$\geq~$}10~cm, {$\geq$}30~cm, {$\geq$}40~cm, and~{$>~$}60~cm. The input data consisted of 3.5 million point observations and 188 feature rasters from various sources. We carefully split the reference data into training and test sets, allowing for independent and robust model validation. Feature selection included an initial screening for multicollinearity using correlation-based feature pruning, followed by final selection using a genetic algorithm. Feature importance was evaluated using permutation importance and SHAP values. The resulting models utilized 26--33 features, achieving overall accuracies and F1-scores between 86--95~\% and 0.82--0.95, respectively. The most important features included soil wetness indices, terrain roughness indices, and natural gamma radiation. Additionally, we provided an approach for evaluating spatial prediction uncertainty based on the models' internal prediction agreement. Compared to existing superficial deposit maps, our peat predictions significantly improve the spatial detail of peatlands at the national level, offering new opportunities for land use planning and emission mitigation. Our exceptionally comprehensive approach is broadly applicable, offering new insights into optimizing machine learning-based digital peatland mapping, particularly through refining feature selection to account for local conditions and enhance prediction accuracy.},

In this paper, we first provide a literature review on the parameters' influence on the prediction performance and on variable importance measures. It is well known that in most cases RF works reasonably well with the default values of the hyperparameters specified in software packages. Nevertheless, tuning the hyperparameters can improve the performance of RF. In the second part of this paper, after a presenting brief overview of tuning strategies, we demonstrate the application of one of the most established tuning strategies, model-based optimization (MBO). To make it easier to use, we provide the tuneRanger R package that tunes RF with MBO automatically. In a benchmark study on several datasets, we compare the prediction performance and runtime of tuneRanger with other tuning implementations in R and RF with default hyperparameters.

The vertical cross-sectional images obtained allow the identification of thickness and lithologic horizons of different media, without destruction. Over the last decade, several studies have demonstrated the potential of GPR. This paper presents a review of recent GPR applications to peatlands, particularly to determine peat stratigraphy. An example study of acquisition and comparison of peatland soil thickness of a fen-dominated watershed located in the James Bay region of Quebec, using (1) a meter stick linked to a GPS RTK and (2) a GSSI GPR, is given. A coefficient of determination (r2) of 56\% was obtained between the ordinary krigings performed on data gathered using both techniques. Disparities occurred mainly in the vicinity of ponds which can be explained by the attenuation of GPR signal in open water. Despite these difficulties ? the higher time required for analysis and the error margin ? it seems more appropriate to use a GPR, instead of a graduated rod linked to a GPS, to measure the peat depths on a site like the one presented in this study. Manual measurements, which are user-dependent in the context of variable mineral substrate densities and with the presence of obstacles in the substrate, may be more subjective.},

While well-established field techniques exist for measuring GWL and DTW, they are generally difficult to scale. In this study, we present a novel workflow for mapping groundwater using orthophotography and photogrammetric point clouds acquired from unmanned aerial vehicles. Our approach takes advantage of the fact that pockets of surface water are normally abundant in peatlands, which we assume to be reflective of GWL in these porous, gently sloping environments. By first classifying surface water and then extracting a sample of water elevations, we can generate continuous models of GWL through interpolation. Estimates of DTW can then be obtained through additional efforts to characterize terrain. We demonstrate our methodology across a complex, 61-ha treed bog in northern Alberta, Canada. An independent accuracy assessment using 31 temporally coincident water-well measurements revealed accuracies (root mean square error) in the 20-cm range, though errors were concentrated in small upland pockets in the study area, and areas of dense tree covers. Model estimates in the open peatland areas were considerably better.},

  abstract = {Gamma-ray spectrometry is an established method in geo-sciences. This article gives an overview on fundamentals of gamma-ray spectrometry that are relevant to soil science including basic technical aspects, and discusses influencing factors, inconsistencies, limitations, and open questions related to the method. Gamma-ray spectrometry relies on counting gamma quanta during radionuclide decay of 40K, 238U, and 232Th, but secular equilibrium for the decay series of U and Th must be given as decays of their respective daughter radionuclides are used for determination. Secular equilibrium for U and Th decay series, however, is not always given leading to, e.g., anomalies in U concentration measurements. For soil science, gamma-ray spectrometry is of specific value since it does not only detect a signal from the landscape surface, but integrates information over a certain volume. Besides, different spatial scales can be covered using either ground-based or airborne sensing techniques. Together with other remote sensing methods, gamma signatures can provide completive information for understanding land forming processes and soil properties distributions. At first, signals depend on bedrock composition. The signals are in second order altered by weathering processes leading to more interpretation opportunities and challenges. Due to their physico-chemical properties, radionuclides behave differently in soils and their properties can be distinguished via the resulting signatures. Hence, gamma signatures of soils are specific for local environments. Processes like soil erosion can superimpose gamma signals from in situ weathering. Soil mappings, available K and texture determination, or peat and soil erosion mapping are possible applications being discussed in this review.},

Here, we examine the predictive capability of TWI using 11 flow-routing algorithms at DEM resolutions 1--30 m. We analyze the relationship between TWI and field-quantified soil moisture using statistical modeling methods and 5,200 study plots with over 46 000 soil moisture measurements. In addition, we test the sensitivity of the flow-routing algorithms against vertical height errors in DEM at different resolutions. The results reveal that the overall predictive capability of TWI was modest. The highest r2 (23.7\%) was reached using a multiple-flow-direction algorithm at 2 m resolution. In addition, the test of sensitivity against height errors revealed that the multiple-flow-direction algorithms were also more robust against DEM errors than single-flow-direction algorithms. The results provide field-evidence indicating that at its best TWI is a modest proxy for soil moisture and its predictive capability is influenced by the flow-routing algorithm and DEM resolution. Thus, we encourage careful evaluation of algorithms and resolutions when using TWI as a proxy for soil moisture.},

  abstract = {Globally, northern peatlands are major carbon deposits with important implications for the climate system. It is therefore crucial to understand their spatial occurrence, especially in the context of peatland degradation by land cover change and climate change. This study was aimed at mapping peatlands in the forested landscape of Sweden by modelling soil data against lidar-based terrain indices. Machine learning methods were used to produce nationwide raster maps at 10 m spatial resolution indicating the presence or not of peatlands. Four different definitions of peatlands were examined: 30, 40, 50 and 100 cm thickness of the organic horizon. Depending on peatland definition, testing with a hold-out dataset indicated an accuracy of 0.89--0.91 and Matthew's correlation coefficient of 0.79--0.81. The final maps showed a national forest peatland extent of 60 292--71 996 km2, estimates which are in the range of previous studies employing traditional soil maps. In conclusion, these results emphasize the possibilities of mapping boreal peatlands with lidar-based terrain indices. The final peatland maps are publicly available at https://doi.org/10.17043/rimondini-2023-peatlands-2 (Rimondini et al., 2023) and may be employed for spatial planning, estimating carbon stocks and evaluating climate change mitigation strategies.},

  abstract = {The estimation of soil carbon stocks is an important component in environmental planning, policy and land management, particularly in the context of climate change mitigation. The following work presents national-scale soil property mapping at 10 m resolution, a level of detail not previously attempted in Scotland. The ultimate aim of this work is to facilitate carbon stock estimation from the soil properties to help inform planning and policy. Scottish organisations possess extensive field-based soil property records obtained through various initiatives, but coverage is inevitably constrained by cost and labour. A modelling-based approach informed by both field measurement, remote sensing imagery and other spatial covariates has the potential to fill the gaps in field-based accounts, providing contiguous estimates of soil carbon content, bulk density, profile depth, organic layer thickness and peat extent. Carbon content, bulk density and profile depth were predicted using machine learning techniques, yielding {\textbackslash} r{\textasciicircum}2 {\textbackslash} scores of 0.78, 0.65 and 0.7, respectively. Presence of peat was determined by the thickness of the organic layer for every grid cell profile (30\% carbon content) that was greater or equal to 50 cm. National carbon stock was calculated by integrating the predicted soil properties down the full profile depth. This work demonstrates that soil properties can be mapped effectively using digital soil mapping techniques at high resolution, on a national scale, providing estimates of carbon stock and peat extent to aid policy makers in decision making.},

To improve the interpretability of their predictions, diagnostic tools such as the widely used local attribution approach known as SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) have been developed. However, the analysis of ML model predictions is only one part of the problem, and there is an interest in obtaining deeper insights into the drivers of the prediction uncertainty as well, i.e. explaining why an ML model is confident given the set of chosen covariate values in addition to why the ML model delivered some particular results. In this study, we show how to apply SHAP to local prediction uncertainty estimates for a case of urban soil pollution -- namely, the presence of petroleum hydrocarbons in soil in Toulouse (France), which pose a health risk via vapour intrusion into buildings, direct soil ingestion, and groundwater contamination. Our results show that the drivers of the prediction best estimates are not necessarily the drivers of confidence in these predictions, and we identify those leading to a reduction in uncertainty. Our study suggests that decisions regarding data collection and covariate characterisation as well as communication of the results should be made accordingly.},

Despite this appeal, existing conformal methods can be unnecessarily conservative because they form intervals of constant or weakly varying length across the input space. In this paper we propose a new method that is fully adaptive to heteroscedasticity. It combines conformal prediction with classical quantile regression, inheriting the advantages of both. We establish a theoretical guarantee of valid coverage, supplemented by extensive experiments on popular regression datasets. We compare the efficiency of conformalized quantile regression to other conformal methods, showing that our method tends to produce shorter intervals.},

  abstract = {Tropical peatland holds a large amount of carbon in the terrestrial ecosystem. Indonesia, responding to the global climate issues, has legislation on the protection and management of the peat ecosystem. However, this effort is hampered by the lack of fine-scale, accurate maps of peat distribution and its thickness. This paper presents an open digital mapping methodology, which utilises open data in an open-source computing environment, as a cost-effective method for mapping peat thickness and estimating carbon stock in Indonesian peatlands. The digital mapping methodology combines field observations with factors that are known to influence peat thickness distribution. These factors are represented by multi-source remotely-sensed data derived from open and freely available raster data: digital elevation models (DEM) from SRTM, geographical information, and radar images (Sentinel and ALOS PALSAR). Utilising machine-learning models from an open-source software, we derived spatial prediction functions and mapped peat thickness and its uncertainty at a grid resolution of 30 m. Peat volume can be calculated from the thickness map, and based on measurements of bulk density and carbon content, carbon stock for the area was estimated. The uncertainty of the estimates was calculated using error propagation rules. We demonstrated this approach in the eastern part of Bengkalis Island in Riau Province, covering an area around 50,000 ha. Results showed that digital mapping method can accurately predict the thickness of peat, explaining up to 98\% of the variation of the data with a median relative error of 5\% or an average error of 0.3 m. The accuracy of this method depends on the number of field observations. We provided an estimate of the cost and time required for map production, i.e. 2 to 4 months with a cost between \$0.3 and \$0.5/ha for an area of 50,000 ha. Obviously, there is a tradeoff between cost and accuracy. The advantages and limitations of the method were further discussed. The methodology provides a blueprint for a national-scale peat mapping. {\copyright} 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

When carried out on foot, such surveys are laborious and time consuming, which limits their application to small domains of limited glaciological interest. Further, crevasses and other hazards make the data acquisition risky. To address these issues, we have developed a drone-based GPR system. The system has a payload weight of 2.2 kg and a data output rate of 14 traces per second. An 80-MHz antenna and a recording time of 2800 ns mean that depths of over 100 m can be reached in temperate ice. Differential GPS positioning assures accurate flight paths. At a speed of 4 m s-1 and height of 5 m above the glacier surface, our system can acquire over 4 line-km of GPR data in 20 min on a single set of drone batteries. After presenting the technical specifications of the system and tests required to optimize its performance, we showcase a recently acquired 3D dataset from the Otemma glacier in Switzerland, where 462 parallel GPR profiles were surveyed at a 1-m line spacing, totaling over 112 line-km of data, in only 4 days.},

Strategies to adequately sample the predictors have been well documented, with the conditioned Latin hypercube sampling (cLHS) algorithm receiving the most attention in the DSM community. Despite advances in sampling design, a critical gap remains in determining the number of samples required for DSM projects. We propose a simple workflow and function coded in R language to determine the minimum sample size for the cLHS algorithm based on histograms of the predictor variables using the Freedman-Diaconis rule for determining optimal bin width. Data preprocessing was included to correct for multimodal and non-normally distributed data, as these can affect sample size determination from the histogram. Based on a user-selected quantile range (QR) for the sample plan, the densities of the histogram bins at the upper and lower bounds of the QR were used as a scaling factor to determine minimum sample size. This technique was applied to a field-scale set of environmental covariates for a well-sampled agricultural study site near Guelph, Ontario, Canada, and tested across a range of QRs. The results showed increasing minimum sample size with an increase in the QR selected. Minimum sample size increased from 44 to 83 when the QR increased from 50\% to 95\% and then increased exponentially to 194 for the 99\% QR. This technique provides an estimate of minimum sample size that can be used as an input to the cLHS algorithm.},

  abstract = {Digital soil mapping (DSM) typically requires three common ingredients: georeferenced samples, environmental covariates, and a model. Of the three, sample design, or the selection of sample size and locations, has received considerably less attention. This is not surprising given that most studies are primarily limited by budget, the result being a focus on stratification of sampling locations in covariate (feature) space with less emphasis placed on the sample size. At the very least, determining the optimal sample size, regardless of whether it is achievable within a given budget, provides critical information about the loss of information from not collecting enough samples for a given study area. In this study, we evaluated the use of the Kullback-Leibler divergence (DKL), the Jensen-Shannon divergence (DJS), the Jenson-Shannon distance (DistJS), and the normalized variance in determining an optimal sample size for predicting total soil carbon at the field scale. The divergence metrics were computed for replicated (n~=~10) sample plans using the conditioned Latin hypercube sampling algorithm across increasing samples sizes of 10, 25, and 50 to 400 in steps of 50 to determine an optimal sample size; the sensitivity of the divergence metrics to increasing the number of covariates and the number of bins for their computations were evaluated. The random forest algorithm was used to train predictive models using the same replicated sample sizes to determine the required sample size to optimize model performance based on root mean square error and Lin's concordance correlation coefficient. The divergence metrics were insensitive to the number of covariates, but very sensitive to the number of bins specified for their calculation. On average, optimal sample size increased linearly (two additional samples per additional bin) regardless of the number of covariates used. The optimal sample sizes were 124, 133 and 220 for the DKL, DJS and DistJS divergence metrics, respectively, while the variance technique proved to be unreliable. Based on the model performance metrics from model validation, the optimal sample size ranged from 146 to 154 samples. The DistJS overestimated the optimal sample size considerably, while the DKL and DJS were quite similar to the optimal sample size determined from model validation. Future work should evaluate the use of divergence metrics for determining optimal sample size for multiple soil properties or classes, using various machine learning models, across different project scales, and with other sampling algorithms.},

We introduced the Jensen-Shannon Divergence (DJS), a novel tool recently applied to DSM, to determine optimal sample sizes for a 2790 km2 area in Ontario, Canada. Utilizing 1791 observations, we generated maps for cation exchange capacity (CEC), clay content, pH, and soil organic carbon (SOC). We then assessed sample sets ranging from 50 to 4000 through conditioned Latin hypercube sampling (cLHS), feature space coverage sampling (FSCS), and simple random sampling (SRS) to calibrate random forest models, analyzing performance via concordance correlation coefficient and root mean square error. Findings reveal DJS as a robust estimator for optimal sample sizes---865 for cLHS, 874 for FSCS, and 869 for SRS, with property-specific optimal sizes indicating the potential for enhanced DSM accuracy. This methodology facilitates a strategic approach to sample size determination, significantly improving the precision of large-scale soil mapping. Conclusively, our research validates the utility of DJS in DSM, offering a scalable solution. This advancement holds considerable promise for improving soil management and sustainability practices, underpinning the critical role of precise soil data in agricultural productivity and environmental conservation.},

  abstract = {The utilization of detailed digital terrain models entails an enhanced basis for supporting sustainable forest management, including the reduction of soil impacts through predictions of site trafficability during mechanized harvesting operations. Since wet soils are prone to traffic-induced damages, soil moisture is incorporated into several systems for spatial predictions of trafficability. Yet, only few systems consider temporal dynamics of soil moisture, impeding the accuracy and practical value of predictions. The depth-to-water (DTW) algorithm calculates a cartographic index which indicates wet areas. Temporal dynamics of soil moisture are simulated by different DTW map-scenarios derived from set flow initiation areas (FIA). However, the concept of simulating seasonal moisture conditions by DTW map-scenarios was not analyzed so far. Therefore, we conducted field campaigns at six study sites across Europe, capturing time-series of soil moisture and soil strength along several transects which crossed predicted wet areas. Assuming overall dry conditions (FIA~=~4.00~ha), DTW predicted 20\% of measuring points to be wet. When a FIA of 1.00~ha (moist conditions) or 0.25~ha (wet conditions) were applied, DTW predicted 29\% or 58\% of points to be wet, respectively. De facto, 82\% of moisture measurements were predicted correctly by the map-scenario for overall dry conditions -- with 44\% of wet measurements deviating from predictions made. The prediction of soil strength was less successful, with 66\% of low values occurring on areas where DTW indicated dryer soils and subsequently a sufficient trafficability. The condition-specific usage of different map-scenarios did not improve the accuracy of predictions, as compared to static map-scenarios, chosen for each site. We assume that site-specific and non-linear hydrological processes compromise the generalized assumptions of simulating overall moisture conditions by different FIA.},

  abstract = {While the application of machine-learning algorithms has been highly simplified in the last years due to their well-documented integration in commonly used statistical programming languages (such as R or Python), there are several practical challenges in the field of ecological modeling related to unbiased performance estimation. One is the influence of spatial autocorrelation in both hyperparameter tuning and performance estimation. Grouped cross-validation strategies have been proposed in recent years in environmental as well as medical contexts to reduce bias in predictive performance. In this study we show the effects of spatial autocorrelation on hyperparameter tuning and performance estimation by comparing several widely used machine-learning algorithms such as boosted regression trees (BRT), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) with traditional parametric algorithms such as logistic regression (GLM) and semi-parametric ones like generalized additive models (GAM) in terms of predictive performance. Spatial and non-spatial cross-validation methods were used to evaluate model performances aiming to obtain bias-reduced performance estimates. A detailed analysis on the sensitivity of hyperparameter tuning when using different resampling methods (spatial/non-spatial) was performed. As a case study the spatial distribution of forest disease (Diplodia sapinea) in the Basque Country (Spain) was investigated using common environmental variables such as temperature, precipitation, soil and lithology as predictors. Random Forest (mean Brier score estimate of 0.166) outperformed all other methods with regard to predictive accuracy. Though the sensitivity to hyperparameter tuning differed between the ML algorithms, there were in most cases no substantial differences between spatial and non-spatial partitioning for hyperparameter tuning. However, spatial hyperparameter tuning maintains consistency with spatial estimation of classifier performance and should be favored over non-spatial hyperparameter optimization. High performance differences (up to 47\%) between the bias-reduced (spatial cross-validation) and overoptimistic (non-spatial cross-validation) cross-validation settings showed the high need to account for the influence of spatial autocorrelation. Overoptimistic performance estimates may lead to false actions in ecological decision making based on biased model predictions.},

  abstract = {Natural scientists and especially ecologists use manipulative experiments or field observations along gradients to differentiate patterns driven by processes from those caused by random noise. A well-conceived sampling design is essential for identifying, analysing and reporting underlying patterns in a statistically solid and reproducible manner, given the normal restrictions in labour, time and money. However, a technical guideline about an adequate sampling design to maximize prediction success under restricted resources is lacking. This study aims at developing such a solid and reproducible guideline for sampling along gradients in all fields of ecology and science in general. We conducted simulations with artificial data for five common response types known in ecology, each represented by a simple function (no response, linear, exponential, symmetric unimodal and asymmetric unimodal). In the simulations, we accounted for different levels of random and systematic error, the two sources of noise in ecological data. We quantified prediction success for varying total sample size, number of locations sampled along a spatial/temporal gradient and number of replicates per sampled location. The number of replicates becomes more important with increasing random error, whereas replicates become less relevant for a systematic error bigger than 20\% of total variation. Thus, if high levels of systematic error are indicated or expected (e.g. in field studies with spatial autocorrelation, unaccountable additional environmental drivers or population clustering), continuous sampling with little to no replication is recommended. In contrast, sampling designs with replications are recommended in studies that can control for systematic errors. In a setting that is characteristic for ecological experiments and field studies strictly controlling for undeterminable systematic error (random error {$\geq$}10\% and systematic error {$\leq$}10\% of total variation), prediction success was best for an intermediate number of sampled locations along the gradient (10--15) and a low number of replicates per location (3). Our findings from reproducible, statistical simulations will help design appropriate and efficient sampling approaches and avoid erroneous conclusions based on studies with flawed sampling design, which is currently one of the main targets of public criticism against science.},

  abstract = {For many decades, kriging and deterministic interpolation techniques, such as inverse distance weighting and nearest neighbour interpolation, have been the most popular spatial interpolation techniques. Kriging with external drift and regression kriging have become basic techniques that benefit both from spatial autocorrelation and covariate information. More recently, machine learning techniques, such as random forest and gradient boosting, have become increasingly popular and are now often used for spatial interpolation. Some attempts have been made to explicitly take the spatial component into account in machine learning, but so far, none of these approaches have taken the natural route of incorporating the nearest observations and their distances to the prediction location as covariates. In this research, we explored the value of including observations at the nearest locations and their distances from the prediction location by introducing Random Forest Spatial Interpolation (RFSI). We compared RFSI with deterministic interpolation methods, ordinary kriging, regression kriging, Random Forest and Random Forest for spatial prediction (RFsp) in three case studies. The first case study made use of synthetic data, i.e., simulations from normally distributed stationary random fields with a known semivariogram, for which ordinary kriging is known to be optimal. The second and third case studies evaluated the performance of the various interpolation methods using daily precipitation data for the 2016--2018 period in Catalonia, Spain, and mean daily temperature for the year 2008 in Croatia. Results of the synthetic case study showed that RFSI outperformed most simple deterministic interpolation techniques and had similar performance as inverse distance weighting and RFsp. As expected, kriging was the most accurate technique in the synthetic case study. In the precipitation and temperature case studies, RFSI mostly outperformed regression kriging, inverse distance weighting, random forest, and RFsp. Moreover, RFSI was substantially faster than RFsp, particularly when the training dataset was large and high-resolution prediction maps were made.},

  abstract = {Optimization of the sampling design is significant for generating accurate soil maps based on samples. Simulated annealing (SA) with the mean squared prediction error (MSE) as objective function has been proven as an effective method for sampling optimization with prior samples for the MSE calculation. In this study, an improved artificial neural network (the improved ANN) was developed firstly and then utilized to calculate the objective function of SA for sampling optimization (named as the improved ANN\_SA). The proposed approach was evaluated to generate optimized samples with a series of samples sizes (from 10 to 500 points) for mapping soil organic matter (SOM) content from the existing 5054 samples in a study area with 1067~km2 in Jiangsu Province, China. A commonly-used sampling optimization using SA with the objective function calculated by regression kriging (named as RK\_SA) was taken as a reference method. The two sampling optimization approaches were compared in mapping SOM using three prediction methods, the improved ANN, regression kriging (RK) and random forest. The results showed that the proposed sampling optimization approach generally achieved more accurate prediction over different sampling sizes. The maximum improvement of prediction accuracy by using the proposed sampling strategy vs. the reference strategy was 12.5\%, 53.6\%, and 15.5\% when using the improved ANN, RK, and random forest as soil mapping methods, respectively. Moreover, the improved ANN and random forest generated more accurate soil predictions than RK with the proposed sampling optimization approach. The superiority of the proposed sampling optimization was more obvious in low sampling densities (smaller than 0.3 points/km2). We conclude that the improved ANN\_SA sampling is a potential effective sampling optimization approach, and machine learning is a promising method for soil mapping when using this sampling approach.},

  abstract = {Effective quantitative land surface analyses in soil science need scale-free land surface attributes (morphometric variables, MVs) to be introduced for making comparable results obtained at different scales. To investigate the problem in more detail, a conceptual scheme and curvatures studied earlier in Shary (1995) [Math. Geol. 27 (1995) 373] are further developed in this paper, formulae for a complete system of 12 curvatures and some other MVs are given, and modified Evans--Young algorithm for curvature calculation is described that does not emphasize grid directions. The conceptual scheme is based on that MVs often describe not the land surface itself, but rather the system ``land surface+vector field'', where vector fields of common interest are gravitational field and solar irradiation. Correspondingly, morphometric variables and concepts may (1) refer to this system description (field-specific), or (2) be invariant with respect to any vector field (field-invariant), that is, describing the land surface itself, its geometrical form. From the other side, MVs and concepts may be (1) local, (2) regional, which need extended portions of a restricted part of land surface for their determination at a given point, or (3) global (planetary), when elevations of all the Earth are needed for their determination at a given point. Global MVs do not consist subject of this paper; so, the four classes of MVs are considered here: class A (local field-specific MVs), class B (regional field-specific), class C (local field-invariant), and class D (regional field-invariant). MVs of these classes permit description of geometrical land form, pre-requisits of surface runoff, thermal regime of slopes, and altitude zonality. Class A contains three independent MVs expressed by first derivatives of elevation Z by plan coordinates (slope steepness, slope direction, solar insolation) and seven curvatures expressed by second derivatives of Z; class C contains five curvatures; class B contains two variables (catchment and dispersal areas); MVs of class D are not introduced yet. Also, some non-system MVs of class A are described, sense of all MVs is described, and interrelationships between MVs are shown. Three curvatures are independent, not two, as this is often implied. It is experimentally shown that average depth of a depression defined in class B may not depend upon scale, while local MVs may not have limit values for large scales. Scale-free morphometric variables are defined here as those that have limit values for large scales. It is experimentally shown that maximal catchment area (class B) is a scale-free variable for thalwegs. These results show that local MVs are scale-specific (except elevation), but scale-free regional MVs might be introduced as a generalization of curvature concept. Two surface runoff accumulation mechanisms are considered in their relation to local and regional field-specific MVs; although the first one is generalized to a regional MV (catchment area), there is no regional MV for the second one description, although it is of great importance in soil science as describing slow profile changes. Geometrical forms were little studied in soil science; arguments are given that they may be useful for studying memory in soils, which is determined by temporal shifts between land surface formation and soil formation processes. The following topics are discussed: the current state of morphometry, an ambiguity in land form definitions, and a possibility to generalize curvature concept for regional scale-free MVs. The consideration is restricted by methods of the general geomorphometry; partial approaches are considered only by selection.},

Uncertainty is expressed in the form of the two quantiles (constituting the prediction interval) of the underlying distribution of prediction errors. The idea is to partition the input space into different zones or clusters having similar model errors using fuzzy c-means clustering. The prediction interval is constructed for each cluster on the basis of empirical distributions of the errors associated with all instances belonging to the cluster under consideration and propagated from each cluster to the examples according to their membership grades in each cluster. Then a regression model is built for in-sample data using computed prediction limits as targets, and finally, this model is applied to estimate the prediction intervals (limits) for out-of-sample data. The method was tested on artificial and real hydrologic data sets using various machine learning techniques. Preliminary results show that the method is superior to other methods estimating the prediction interval. A new method for evaluating performance for estimating prediction interval is proposed as well.},

  abstract = {Knowledge on peat volumes is essential to estimate carbon stocks accurately and to facilitate appropriate peatland management. This study used airborne electromagnetic and radiometric data to estimate the volume of a bog. Airborne methods provide an alternative to ground-based methods, which are labor intensive and unfeasible to capture large-scale ({$>$}10 km(2)) spatial information. An airborne geophysical survey conducted in 2004 covered large parts of the Ahlen-Falkenberger Moor, an Atlantic peat bog (39 km(2)) close to the German North Sea coast. The lateral extent of the bog was derived from low radiometric and elevated surface data. The vertical extent resulted from smooth resistivity models derived from 1D inversion of airborne electromagnetic data, in combination with a steepest gradient approach, which indicated the base of the less resistive peat. Relative peat thicknesses were also derived from decreasing radiation over peatlands. The scaling factor (mu(a) = 0.28 m(-1)) required to transform the exposure rates (negative log-values) to thicknesses was calculated using the electromagnetic results as reference. The mean difference of combined airborne results and peat thicknesses of about 100 boreholes is very small (0.0 +/- 1.1 m). Although locally some (5\%) deviations ({$>$}2 m) from the borehole results do occur, the approach presented here enables fast peat volume mapping of large areas without an imperative necessity of borehole data.},

Roadmap for generating a soil map for Norwegian pristine mires. NINA Report 2374. Norwegian Institute for Nature Research.   Under the umbrella of larger project `{\O}kologik tilstand', we created a roadmap for mapping soil biogeochemistry of Norwegian mires. Mapping soil characteristics, especially carbon and nitrogen stocks as well as their other chemical parameters, as well as physical and biological variables is important to better understand the consequences of various planned disturbances as well as their magnitude.\,\,\,   We searched for the availability of existing Norwegian contemporary and historical data to characterize future data requirements and to test predictive models applying remote sensing tools. To the date, only two datasets are available: a small limited contemporary data set published in Kyrkjeeide et al. (2023) and a large historical dataset collected by `Myrselskapet' (Hovde 1971) and published and stored by NIBIO.   We digitalized and georeferenced this historical dataset, which is now published in Living Norway (Silvennoinen et al. 2023). The consists of various types of peatlands including drained and pristine and used selected parts of it to test the predictive models for mapping carbon and nitrogen densities. This was done as a pilot project to explore the potential for remote sensing and spatial modelling to monitor Norwegian mires. Our pilot study revealed that although we could map carbon and nitrogen densities, the models were attributed with large uncertainties. The models explained between 22 and 24\% of the variance in carbon and nitrogen densities. This highlights the need for gathering contemporary in-situ field data for training and ground-truthing remote sensing models before they can be used for developing national soil maps for mires. The limited amount of `Myrselskapet' data which is spatially biased (ie. concentrated in selected areas in Norway) combined with data age (between 61 and 85 years old) makes spatial modelling of mire geochemistry challenging. The dataset is also limited in the amount of data for critical variables, namely peat depth, in order to compute carbon and nitrogen stocks reliably.\,   Ongoing national soil monitoring programs concentrate on agricultural (JORVAAK - program) and forest soils (`Overv{\aa}king av jordkarbon i skog og beitemark') but fail to cover pristine mires. To generate a soil map for Norwegian mires, we emphasize the need for contemporary national data for ground-truthing remote sensing modelling methods. At this end, we recommend a onetime intensive sampling campaign (carbon, nitrogen and basic soil physical parameters with vertical and horizontal distribution along with peat depth measurements) for main mire types in Norway to generate a database that can be used to calibrate results from less intensive campaigns with larger geographic coverage. The generated data should be maintained in open access databases.   Estimated costs to generate a national soil map for peatlands are following:   1. Intensive data collection from selected mires to calculate carbon stocks  2. Extensive collection of peat depth data with large national coverage  3. Modelling the soil map  Costs related to point 1 are 1\,450\,000 kr for sampling of selected 30 mires. These costs include personnel and analysis costs but exclude travel costs. Inclusion of nitrogen analysis will increase the cost estimate by 500\,000 kr.   We also recommend that soil depth measurements are included in ongoing soil monitoring programs on peatlands, which have broad national coverage (e.g., ANO). Costs related to point 2. are 75 000 kr per year (coordination, planning and data-analysis), and added field sampling costs of 15\,000 - 30\,000 kr (without travel costs) per ANO -- location. Price per ANO-location varies depending on size and depth of mires at the location. Adding soil sampling (for better recording of carbon stocks) will increase prices per ANO- location by an estimated 10\,000 kr.   Costs related to point 3. remote sense modelling of soil carbon content in 3-5 years are estimated to be 800\,000 kr -- 1\,200\,000 kr, assuming that data collection presented in points 1 and 2 are carried out.\,   Current methodology for measuring peat depth (the most critical parameter to quantify soil carbon stocks) is laborious and time consuming. Various methods including landscape modelling and remote sensing are being tested and developed internationally. Building up competence and incorporating such techniques in Norway would significantly expedite developing a comprehensive map for soil carbon stocks in Norwegian mires.},

The TWI was calculated by varying six parameters affecting the distribution of accumulated area among downslope cells and by varying the way the slope was calculated. All possible combinations of these parameters were calculated for two separate boreal forest sites in northern Sweden. We did not find a calculation method that performed best for all measured variables; rather the best methods seemed to be variable and site specific. However, we were able to identify some general characteristics of the best methods for different groups of measured variables.

  abstract = {Peatlands are undeniably an important asset in climate change management. Still, even today many of the natural peatlands in Norway are in danger of being dried in order to build new cabins, highways or wind parks. Traditionally, confirming peat occurrences can require some extensive fieldwork. Traversing the areas by foot has for long been the only method of locating new peat deposits in an accurrate way. This study aims to discover and confirm if remotely sensed data could be used to find new peat deposits reliably. Recently, LiDAR and radiometric (gamma-ray spectrometric) data have shown potential, and this is a first time researching peat occurrence in a study area with such a great variation in topography.     The characteristics of the study area in Skrimfjella inspired the predictor selection used in this thesis. 106 peat occurrence points and 123 added positive occurrence points (from peat depth measurements) were visited in the study area and examined in relation to the Digital Elevation Model-derived predictors: elevation, slope, topographic wetness index, heat index and aspect favorability. Additionally, the radiometric predictors uranium, thorium and potassium as well as the combination of these three were used for modeling of the relationships between the predictors and the occurrence points. Slope, topographic wetness index and elevation had the most explanatory value, while uranium was the most predictive radiometric predictor. The final model included these predictors and only had a sensitivity of 0.28, meaning that the model could only identify 28\% of the existing peat. The specificity was 0.96, meaning that when the model identified peat, it was typically right. Model accuracy was 50\%. The failure of the radiometric predictor performance could be traced back to the various bedrock types affecting the spectrometer measurements in Skrimfjella. The better performance of the topographic predictors not based on aspect, is likely due to the variable characteristics in the study area. With proper spectrometer calibrations and a decent sample size, using remotely sensed data for estimating peat occurrence has a great potential for peatland management and therefore, climate change mitigation.},

  abstract = {Supervised learning allows the prediction of variables measured in-situ from variables that can be measured from satellites. A labeled data set for this purpose is typically created by matching in-situ and satellite data and split into subsets for model training and initial validation. However, the available data are often not randomly distributed in space and time. In theory, this can bias estimates of prediction errors. Here, remote sensing of chlorophyll a in the Baltic Sea serves as an example to demonstrate the importance of this problem in marine remote sensing, and to test how well different statistical designs for validation mitigate it. Semi-synthetic data sets were created by combining daily chlorophyll a fields from a biogeochemical model hindcast with real-world locations and times of in-situ measurements, generated by sampling 2,000 combinations of cruises from an oceanographic database. These data sets were matched with co-located satellite data and used to train and validate four algorithms using remote sensing reflectances as input. The algorithms were validated using different methods including random hold-out sets and various block cross-validation designs based on geographical location, time, or location in predictor space. The resulting error estimates were compared to true errors calculated from differences to the biogeochemical model outputs serving as response variable. All validation methods underestimated prediction errors, in many cases by {$>$}30\%. While a simple band-ratio algorithm had the smallest true errors (e.g., absolute percentage difference: APD~=~50\%), estimated errors were smallest for more complicated and in fact less accurate machine learning algorithms. For example, ten-fold cross-validation led to selection of the truly best algorithm among four candidates for {$<$}10\% of data sets. The biases were smallest, but not absent, for spatial block cross-validation, which selected the truly best algorithm for 21--46\% of data sets, depending on the error measure. When the analyses were repeated with data that were randomly distributed in space and time, the biases of error estimates based on random splits became much smaller (e.g., 10-fold cross-validation estimated errors within 2\% of their true values and selected the truly best algorithm for {$>$}99\% of data sets), spatial block cross-validation overestimated prediction errors (often by {$>$}40\%), all algorithms achieved lower true errors, and a random forest made the most accurate predictions overall (APD~=~27\%). These results show that more attention should be paid to statistical methods for estimating the errors of supervised learning algorithms, e.g., by using multiple validation methods in combination and critically discussing error estimates considering questions of dependence, representativeness, and stationarity. Furthermore, non-random spatiotemporal distribution of labeled data can be a barrier to harnessing the full potential of machine learning algorithms in marine remote sensing.},

  abstract = {Background: Random forests are becoming increasingly popular in many scientific fields because they can cope with "small n large p" problems, complex interactions and even highly correlated predictor variables. Their variable importance measures have recently been suggested as screening tools for, e.g., gene expression studies. However, these variable importance measures show a bias towards correlated predictor variables. Results: We identify two mechanisms responsible for this finding: (i) A preference for the selection of correlated predictors in the tree building process and (ii) an additional advantage for correlated predictor variables induced by the unconditional permutation scheme that is employed in the computation of the variable importance measure. Based on these considerations we develop a new, conditional permutation scheme for the computation of the variable importance measure. Conclusion: The resulting conditional variable importance reflects the true impact of each predictor variable more reliably than the original marginal approach.},

  abstract = {Most calibration sampling designs for Digital Soil Mapping (DSM) demarcate spatially distinct sample sites. In practical applications major challenges are often limited field accessibility and the question on how to integrate legacy soil samples to cope with usually scarce resources for field sampling and laboratory analysis. The study focuses on the development and application of an efficiency improved DSM sampling design that (1) applies an optimized sample set size, (2) compensates for limited field accessibility, and (3) enables the integration of legacy soil samples. The proposed sampling design represents a modification of conditioned Latin Hypercube Sampling (cLHS), which originally returns distinct sample sites to optimally cover a soil related covariate space and to preserve the correlation of the covariates in the sample set. The sample set size was determined by comparing multiple sample set sizes of original cLHS sets according to their representation of the covariate space. Limited field accessibility and the integration of legacy samples were incorporated by providing alternative sample sites to replace the original cLHS sites. We applied the modified cLHS design (cLHSadapt) in a small catchment (4.2 km2) in Central China to model topsoil sand fractions using Random Forest regression (RF). For evaluating the proposed approach, we compared cLHSadapt with the original cLHS design (cLHSorig). With an optimized sample set size n = 30, the results show a similar representation of the cLHS covariate space between cLHSadapt and cLHSorig, while the correlation between the covariates is preserved (r = 0.40 vs. r = 0.39). Furthermore, we doubled the sample set size of cLHSadapt by adding available legacy samples (cLHSadapt+) and compared the prediction accuracies. Based on an external validation set cLHSval (n = 20), the coefficient of determination (R2) of the cLHSadapt predictions range between 0.59 and 0.71 for topsoil sand fractions. The R2-values of the RF predictions based on cLHSadapt+, using additional legacy samples, are marginally increased on average by 5\%.},

  abstract = {Spatial 3-D information on soil hydraulic properties for areas larger than plot scale is usually derived using indirect methods such as pedotransfer functions (PTFs) due to the lack of measured information on them. PTFs describe the relationship between the desired soil hydraulic parameter and easily available soil properties based on a soil hydraulic reference dataset. Soil hydraulic properties of a catchment or region can be calculated by applying PTFs on available soil maps. Our aim was to analyse the performance of (i) indirect (using PTFs) and (ii) direct (geostatistical) mapping methods to derive 3-D soil hydraulic properties. The study was performed on the Balaton catchment area in Hungary, where density of measured soil hydraulic data fulfils the requirements of geostatistical methods. Maps of saturated water content (0\&thinsp;cm matric potential), field capacity (-330\&thinsp;cm matric potential) and wilting point (-15\&thinsp;000\&thinsp;cm matric potential) for 0--30, 30--60 and 60--90\&thinsp;cm soil depth were prepared. PTFs were derived using the random forest method on the whole Hungarian soil hydraulic dataset, which includes soil chemical, physical, taxonomical and hydraulic properties of some 12\&thinsp;000 samples complemented with information on topography, climate, parent material, vegetation and land use. As a direct and thus geostatistical method, random forest combined with kriging (RFK) was applied to 359 soil profiles located in the Balaton catchment area. There were no significant differences between the direct and indirect methods in six out of nine maps having root-mean-square-error values between 0.052 and 0.074\&thinsp;cm3\&thinsp;cm-3, which is in accordance with the internationally accepted performance of hydraulic PTFs. The PTF-based mapping method performed significantly better than the RFK for the saturated water content at 30--60 and 60--90\&thinsp;cm soil depth; in the case of wilting point the RFK outperformed the PTFs at 60--90\&thinsp;cm depth. Differences between the PTF-based and RFK mapped values are less than 0.025\&thinsp;cm3\&thinsp;cm-3 for 65\&thinsp;\%--86\&thinsp;\&thinsp;\% of the catchment. In RFK, the uncertainty of input environmental covariate layers is less influential on the mapped values, which is preferable. In the PTF-based method the uncertainty of mapping soil hydraulic properties is less computationally intensive. Detailed comparisons of maps derived from the PTF-based method and the RFK are presented in this paper.},

Upslope area is then calculated by proportioning flow between two downslope pixels according to how close this flow direction is to the direct angle to the downslope pixel. This procedure offers improvements over prior procedures that have restricted flow to eight possible directions (introducing grid bia) or proportioned flow according to slope (introducing unrealistic dispersion). The new procedure is more robust than prior procedures based on fitting local planes while retaining a simple grid based structure. Detailed algorithms are presented and results are demonstrated through test examples and application to digital elevation data sets.},

  abstract = {Biogeomorphic wetlands cover 1\% of Earth's surface but store 20\% of ecosystem organic carbon. This disproportional share is fueled by high carbon sequestration rates and effective storage in peatlands, mangroves, salt marshes, and seagrass meadows, which greatly exceed those of oceanic and forest ecosystems. Here, we review how feedbacks between geomorphology and landscape-building vegetation underlie these qualities and how feedback disruption can switch wetlands from carbon sinks into sources. Currently, human activities are driving rapid declines in the area of major carbon-storing wetlands (1\% annually). Our findings highlight the urgency to stop through conservation ongoing losses and to reestablish landscape-forming feedbacks through restoration innovations that recover the role of biogeomorphic wetlands as the world's biotic carbon hotspots.           ,              Restoring wetlands for carbon                            Wetlands disproportionately contribute to carbon sequestration globally. However, the ability of wetlands to store carbon depends on feedbacks between vegetation and geomorphology that allow wetlands to continue to develop over long time periods. When these feedbacks break down, wetlands can become carbon sources. Temmink               et al               . reviewed recent research on the role of plant-landform interactions in wetland carbon storage and the potential for restoration to restore these critical processes. ---BEL                        ,              A review explains that restoring plant-landform linkages is critical to harnessing the carbon sequestration potential of wetlands.           ,                             BACKGROUND                                Evaluating effects of global warming from rising atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO                 2                 ) concentrations requires resolving the processes that drive Earth's carbon stocks and flows. Although biogeomorphic wetlands (peatlands, mangroves, salt marshes, and seagrass meadows) cover only 1\% of Earth's surface, they store 20\% of the global organic ecosystem carbon. This disproportionate share is fueled by high carbon sequestration rates per unit area and effective storage capacity, which greatly exceed those of oceanic and forest ecosystems. We highlight that feedbacks between geomorphology and landscape-building wetland vegetation underlie these critical qualities and that disruption of these biogeomorphic feedbacks can switch these systems from carbon sinks into sources.                                                        ADVANCES               A key advancement in understanding wetland functioning has been the recognition of the role of reciprocal organism-landform interactions, ``biogeomorphic feedbacks.'' Biogeomorphic feedbacks entail self-reinforcing interactions between biota and geomorphology, by which organisms---often vegetation---engineer landforms to their own benefit following a positive density-dependent relationship. Vegetation that dominates major carbon-storing wetlands generate self-facilitating feedbacks that shape the landscape and amplify carbon sequestration and storage. As a result, per unit area, wetland carbon stocks and sequestration rates greatly exceed those of terrestrial forests and oceans, ecosystems that worldwide harbor large stocks because of their large areal extent.               Worldwide biogeomorphic wetlands experience human-induced average annual loss rates of around 1\%. We estimate that associated carbon losses amount to 0.5 Pg C per year, levels that are equivalent to 5\% of the estimated overall anthropogenic carbon emissions. Because carbon emissions from degraded wetlands are often sustained for centuries until all organic matter has been decomposed, conserving and restoring biogeomorphic wetlands must be part of global climate solutions.                                         OUTLOOK               Our work highlights that biogeomorphic wetlands serve as the world's biotic carbon hotspots, and that conservation and restoration of these hotspots offer an attractive contribution to mitigate global warming. Recent scientific findings show that restoration methods aimed at reestablishing biogeomorphic feedbacks can greatly increase establishment success and restoration yields, paving the way for large-scale restoration actions. Therefore, we argue that implementing such measures can facilitate humanity in its pursuit of targets set by the Paris Agreement and the United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration.                                                   Carbon storage in biogeomorphic wetlands.                                        Organic carbon (                     A                     ) stocks, (                     B                     ) densities, and (                     C                     ) sequestration rates in the world's major carbon-storing ecosystems. Oceans hold the largest stock, peatlands (boreal, temperate, and tropical aggregated) store the largest amount per unit area, and coastal ecosystems (mangroves, salt marshes, and seagrasses aggregated) support the highest sequestration rates. (                     D                     and                     E                     ) Biogeomorphic feedbacks, indicated with arrows, can be classified as productivity stimulating or decomposition limiting. Productivity-stimulating feedbacks increase resource availability and thus stimulate vegetation growth and organic matter production. Although production is lower in wetlands with decomposition-limiting feedbacks, decomposition is more strongly limited, resulting in net accumulation of organic matter. (D) In fens, organic matter accumulation from vascular plants is amplified by productivity-stimulating feedbacks. Once the peat rises above the groundwater and is large enough to remain waterlogged by retaining rainwater, the resulting bog maintains being waterlogged and acidic, resulting in strong decomposition-limiting feedbacks. (E) Vegetated coastal ecosystems generate productivity-stimulating feedbacks that enhance local production and trapping of external organic matter.},

  abstract = {Drainage has turned peatlands from a carbon sink into one of the world's largest greenhouse gas (GHG) sources from cultivated soils. We analyzed a unique data set (12 peatlands, 48 sites and 122 annual budgets) of mainly unpublished GHG emissions from grasslands on bog and fen peat as well as other soils rich in soil organic carbon (SOC) in Germany. Emissions and environmental variables were measured with identical methods. Site-averaged GHG budgets were surprisingly variable (29.2 {\textpm} 17.4 t CO2-eq. ha-1 yr-1) and partially higher than all published data and the IPCC default emission factors for GHG inventories. Generally, CO2 (27.7 {\textpm} 17.3 t CO2 ha-1 yr-1) dominated the GHG budget. Nitrous oxide (2.3 {\textpm} 2.4 kg N2O-N ha-1 yr-1) and methane emissions (30.8 {\textpm} 69.8 kg CH4-C ha-1 yr-1) were lower than expected except for CH4 emissions from nutrient-poor acidic sites. At single peatlands, CO2 emissions clearly increased with deeper mean water table depth (WTD), but there was no general dependency of CO2 on WTD for the complete data set. Thus, regionalization of CO2 emissions by WTD only will remain uncertain. WTD dynamics explained some of the differences between peatlands as sites which became very dry during summer showed lower emissions. We introduced the aerated nitrogen stock (Nair) as a variable combining soil nitrogen stocks with WTD. CO2 increased with Nair across peatlands. Soils with comparatively low SOC concentrations showed as high CO2 emissions as true peat soils because Nair was similar. N2O emissions were controlled by the WTD dynamics and the nitrogen content of the topsoil. CH4 emissions can be well described by WTD and ponding duration during summer. Our results can help both to improve GHG emission reporting and to prioritize and plan emission reduction measures for peat and similar soils at different scales.},

Pilotpro-sjektet testet feltmetodikken p{\aa} 41 ulike flater i Tr{\o}ndelag i 2018. Utvalget ble fors{\o}ksvis stratifisert p{\aa} hoved{\o}kosystemene skog, fjell, v{\aa}tmark og semi-naturlig mark. For den praktiske gjennomf{\o}ringen av registreringene i felt var det n{\o}dvendig med en sekund{\ae}r utvel-gelsesprosess av flater som tok hensyn til logistikk, fremkommelighet og sikkerhet.  P{\aa} hver flate ble det etablert et regul{\ae}rt forband med 36 punkter. Grunnet begrenset tid i felt ble registreringer foretatt p{\aa} 12 av 36 punkter per flate. Registreringer ble foretatt p{\aa} to romlige skalaer: 1 m2 (dekningsgrad av alle karplantearter) og 250 m2 (en rekke variabler, herunder dekning av ulike sjikt og fremmede arter). P{\aa} hvert punkt ble naturtypen kartlagt etter Natur i Norge (NiN) sin kartleggingsinstruks for m{\aa}lestokk 1:5000.  Kapittel 2 og 3 omhandler arbeidet som ble utf{\o}rt i pilotprosjektet og vi foresl{\aa}r med bakgrunn i erfaringene en revisjon av feltmetodikk med tilh{\o}rende protokoll. Kapittel 4 omtaler lagring og h{\aa}ndtering av fritt tilgjengelige data. I kapittel 5 diskuterer vi metodikk for overv{\aa}king og alternativer for implementering av ANO p{\aa} landsbasis. Basert p{\aa} resultater fra pilotstudien simuleres usikkerhet i estimater av indikatorer for {\o}kologisk tilstand som funksjon av antall flater og punkter per flate, som grunnlag for anbefalinger til endelig overv{\aa}kingsopplegg.  Vi anbefaler tilfeldig utvalg av flater, da arealrepresentativitet er et uttalt m{\aa}l for ANO. Et tilfeldig utvalg vil imidlertid f{\o}re til at mindre regioner f{\aa}r f{\ae}rre flater, hvilket kan medf{\o}re utfordringer ift. datagrunnlag for indikatorer for {\o}kologisk tilstand p{\aa} regionniv{\aa}. Derfor anbefales en fortetting av utvalget i mindre regioner. Det anbefales ikke {\aa} stratifisere utvalget ift. hoved{\o}kosystem da v{\aa}r vurdering er at det ikke finnes tilstrekkelig gode kartlag dette kan baseres p{\aa}. Dette gjelder ogs{\aa} semi-naturlig mark, som vil v{\ae}re vanskelig {\aa} fange opp gjennom arealrepresentativ overv{\aa}king, da det dekker sv{\ae}rt lite av Norges areal. Det b{\o}r p{\aa} sikt vurderes egne tilleggsmoduler i overv{\aa}kingsprogrammet for {\aa} f{\aa} nok flater i semi-naturlige naturtyper og eventuelt andre niv{\aa} 2-enheter som dekkes d{\aa}rlig.  Vi anbefaler at overv{\aa}kingen omfatter 1000 flater og registrering p{\aa} 18 punkter per flate. Dette vil gi statistisk holdbare resultater med relativt god presisjon, i hvert fall av vanlig forekommende hoved{\o}kosystemer, og er realistisk i forhold til praktisk gjennomf{\o}ring. Vi anbefaler et 5-{\aa}rig omdrev med {\aa}rlig registrering av 200 flater.},

The aim was to provide an estimate of the observational uncertainty in peat depth due to positioning error, and the prediction uncertainty of the computed model. The data were GPS position and ground penetrating radar depth measurements of six mires in different parts of Finland. The calculated observational uncertainty for Finnish mires in general caused, for example, by a 20 m positioning error, is 43 cm in depth with 95 \% confidence. The peat depth statistics differed among the six mires, and it is recommended that the mire specific function ∆dm(∆r) is defined for each individual mire to obtain the best estimate of observational uncertainty. Knowledge of the observational error and function ∆dm(∆r) should be used in peat depth modelling for defining the uncertainty of depth predictions.},

Therefore, any prediction of a soil property that can be derived from these products has an irreducible uncertainty that needs to be mapped. The objective of this study was to compare the most current DSM method -- Regression Kriging (RK) -- with a new approach derived from RandomForest -- Quantile Regression Forest (QRF) -- in regard to their ability of predicting the uncertainties of GlobalSoilMap soil property grids. The comparison was performed for three soil properties, pH, organic carbon and clay content at 5--15cm depth in a 27,236km2 Mediterranean French region with sparse sets of measured soil profiles (1/13.5km2) and for a set of environmental covariates characterizing the relief, climate, geology and land use of the region. Apart from classical performance indicators, comparisons involved accuracy plots and the visual examinations of the uncertainty maps provided by the two methods. The results obtained for the three soil properties showed that QRF provided more accurate and more interpretable predicted patterns of uncertainty than RK did, while having similar performances in predicting soil properties. The use of QRF in operational DSM is therefore recommended, especially when spatial sampling of soil observations are too sparse for applying RK.},

  abstract = {For many decades, soil scientists have produced spatial estimates of soil properties using statistical and non-statistical mapping models. Commonly in soil mapping studies the map quality is assessed through pairwise comparison of observed and predicted values of a soil property, from which statistical indices summarizing the quality of the entire map are computed. Often these indices are based on average error and correlation statistics. In this study, we recommend a more appropriate and effective method of map evaluation by means of Taylor and solar diagrams. Taylor and solar diagrams are summary diagrams exploiting the relationship between statistical indices to visualize differentiable aspects of map quality into a single plot. An important advantage over current map quality evaluation is that map quality can be assessed from the combined effect of a few statistical quantities, not just on the basis of a single index or list of indices. We illustrate the use of common statistical indices and their combination into summary diagrams with a simulation study and two applications on soil data. In the simulation study nine maps with known statistical properties are produced and evaluated with tables and summary diagrams. In the first case study with soil data, change in the quality of a large-scale topsoil organic carbon map is tracked for a number of permutations in the mapping model parameters, whereas in the second case study several maps of topsoil organic carbon content for the same area, made by various statistical and non-statistical models, are compared and evaluated. We consider that in all cases better insights in map quality are obtained with summary diagrams, instead of using a single index or an extensive list of indices. This underpins the importance of using integrated summary graphics to communicate on quantitative map quality so as to avoid excessive trust that a single map quality index may suggest.},

  abstract = {The uptake of machine learning (ML) algorithms in digital soil mapping (DSM) is transforming the way soil scientists produce their maps. Within the past two decades, soil scientists have applied ML to a wide range of scenarios, by mapping soil properties or classes with various ML algorithms, on spatial scale from the local to the global, and with depth. The wide adoption of ML for soil mapping was made possible by the increase in data availability, the ease of accessing environmental spatial data, and the development of software solutions aided by computational tools to analyse them. In this article, we review the current use of ML in DSM, identify the key challenges and suggest solutions from the existing literature. There is a growing interest in the use of ML in DSM. Most studies emphasize prediction and accuracy of the predicted maps for applications, such as baseline production of quantitative soil information. Few studies account for existing soil knowledge in the modelling process or quantify the uncertainty of the predicted maps. Further, we discuss the challenges related to the application of ML for soil mapping and suggest solutions from existing studies in the natural sciences. The challenges are: sampling, resampling, accounting for the spatial information, multivariate mapping, uncertainty analysis, validation, integration of pedological knowledge and interpretation of the models. Overall, the current literature shows few attempts in understanding the underlying soil structure or process using the predicted maps and the ML model, for example by generating hypotheses on mechanistic relationships among variables. In this regard, several additional challenging aspects need to be considered, such as the inclusion of pedological knowledge in the ML algorithm or the interpretability of the calibrated ML model. Tackling these challenges is critical for ML to gain credibility and scientific consistency in soil science. We conclude that for future developments, ML could incorporate three core elements: plausibility, interpretability, and explainability, which will trigger soil scientists to couple model prediction with pedological explanation and understanding of the underlying soil processes.},

  abstract = {Machine learning techniques are widely employed to generate digital soil maps. The map accuracy is partly determined by the number and spatial locations of the measurements used to calibrate the machine learning model. However, determining the optimal sampling design for mapping with machine learning techniques has not yet been considered in detail in digital soil mapping studies. In this paper, we investigate sampling design optimization for soil mapping with random forest. A design is optimized using spatial simulated annealing by minimizing the mean squared prediction error (MSE). We applied this approach to mapping soil organic carbon for a part of Europe using subsamples of the LUCAS dataset. The optimized subsamples are used as input for the random forest machine learning model, using a large set of readily available environmental data as covariates. We also predicted the same soil property using subsamples selected by simple random sampling, conditioned Latin Hypercube sampling (cLHS), spatial coverage sampling and feature space coverage sampling. Distributions of the estimated population MSEs are obtained through repeated random splitting of the LUCAS dataset, serving as the population of interest, into subsets used for validation, testing and selection of calibration samples, and repeated selection of calibration samples with the various sampling designs. The differences between the medians of the MSE distributions were tested for significance using the non-parametric Mann-Whitney test. The process was repeated for different sample sizes. We also analyzed the spread of the optimized designs in both geographic and feature space to reveal their characteristics. Results show that optimization of the sampling design by minimizing the MSE is worthwhile for small sample sizes. However, an important disadvantage of sampling design optimization using MSE is that it requires known values of the soil property at all locations and as a consequence is only feasible for subsampling an existing dataset. For larger sample sizes, the effect of using an MSE optimized design diminishes. In this case, we recommend to use a sample spread uniformly in the feature (i.e. covariate) space of the most important random forest covariates. The results also show that for our case study, cLHS sampling performs worse than the other sampling designs for mapping with random forest. We stress that comparison of sampling designs for calibration by splitting the data just once is very sensitive to the data split that one happens to use if the validation set is small.},

These studies commonly evaluate the map accuracy through cross-validation with the data used for calibrating the underlying mapping model. Recent studies, however, have argued that cross-validation statistics of most mapping studies are optimistically biased. They attribute these overoptimistic results to a supposed serious methodological flaw in standard cross-validation methods, namely that these methods ignore spatial autocorrelation in the data. They argue that spatial cross-validation should be used instead, and contend that standard cross-validation methods are inherently invalid in a geospatial context because of the autocorrelation present in most spatial data. Here we argue that these studies propagate a widespread misconception of statistical validation of maps. We explain that unbiased estimates of map accuracy indices can be obtained by probability sampling and design-based inference and illustrate this with a numerical experiment on large-scale above-ground biomass mapping. In our experiment, standard cross-validation (i.e., ignoring autocorrelation) led to smaller bias than spatial cross-validation. Standard cross-validation was deficient in case of a strongly clustered dataset that had large differences in sampling density, but less so than spatial cross-validation. We conclude that spatial cross-validation methods have no theoretical underpinning and should not be used for assessing map accuracy, while standard cross-validation is deficient in case of clustered data. Model-free, design-unbiased and valid accuracy assessment is achieved with probability sampling and design-based inference. It is valid without the need to explicitly incorporate or adjust for spatial autocorrelation and perfectly suited for the validation of large scale biological, ecological and environmental maps.},

  abstract = {Identification and removal of surface depressions is a critical step for automated modelling of surface rainfall runoff based on Digital Elevation Models (DEMs). At present, nearly all GIS and hydrologic software packages employ Jenson and Domingue's method for preparing depressionless DEMs for hydrologic analysis. This conventional method is computationally intensive and time-consuming. With the growing availability of high-resolution DEMs produced by airborne LIDAR and InSAR techniques, GIS-based hydrologic applications often need to handle larger geographic areas at finer resolutions. In the face of high-resolution DEMs, the conventional method becomes inadequate and deficient. In this paper, we present a new method for efficiently identifying and filling surface depressions in DEMs. This method can simultaneously determine flow paths and spatial partition of watersheds with one pass of processing. A novel concept of spill elevation and the least-cost search for optimal flow paths are the two cornerstones of our method. The time complexity of our method is in O(Nlog N). It has been implemented using C++ programming language and successfully applied to USGS DEMs and LIDAR DEMs of various sizes. Experiments show that our method outperforms the conventional method by a factor of over 30, in terms of running time.},

However, the prediction locations can be substantially different from the available sample, leading to over-optimistic evaluation results. This has fostered the development of spatial CV methods. Yet these methods only focus on spatial autocorrelation and cannot sufficiently guarantee that the validation subset is a good proxy of the test set with significant differences. In this paper, we propose the spatial+ cross-validation (SP-CV) method. This method, which considers both the geographic and feature spaces, is composed of two stages. The first stage addresses spatial autocorrelation issues by using agglomerative hierarchical clustering to divide the available sample into blocks. The second stage deals with multiple sources of differences. It uses cluster ensembles to split the blocks into training and validation folds based on the locations of the sample data and the values of the covariates and target variable. The proposed method is compared against random and block CV methods in a series of experiments with Amazon basin above ground biomass and California houseprice datasets. Our results show that SP-CV provided the smallest error differences with respect to the reference error. This means that SP-CV produced more representative splits and led to more reliable model evaluations. It suggests that a reliable model evaluation requires to consider both the geographic and the feature spaces in a comprehensive manner.},

  abstract = {Peatlands, occupying merely 5\% of the Earth's land surface, are an important carbon sink, storing up to double the carbon of the world's forests. The quantification of global peatlands carbon stock and their spatial distribution, however, poses a significant challenge due to their heterogeneous nature and the complex hydroecological processes that govern their formation. Using the Global Peatland Map (GPM 2.0), this study employed a digital soil mapping approach to predict peat thickness, and multilayer bulk density (BD) and carbon content (CC) globally. We applied the Quantile Random Forest (QRF) algorithm, informed by land surface data (soil, climate, organisms, and topography), to develop regional models for peat thickness and global models for BD and CC. Peat thickness models, based on approximately 27,000 data points, demonstrated good predictive performance, with the highest accuracy observed in African peatlands (validation R2~=~0.61). In contrast, BD ({$\sim$}19,000 points) and CC ({$\sim$}9,000 points) models showed more variable performance across different soil layers (average R2~=~0.45 and R2~=~0.22, respectively). Feature importance analysis indicated that elevation and climate were key predictors, particularly in Latin America and South--Southeast Asia. Applying the models to 1~km resolution covariates across the world, our predicted peat thickness map aligned well with existing high-resolution regional maps. By incorporating error propagation rules, we estimated the global peatlands carbon stock to be 942~{\textpm}~312 Pg C over an area of 6.75 million km2. Our results, including detailed maps, are available to facilitate further global peatland analyses and modelling endeavours.},

Although recognised for their significant role in the global carbon cycle, discovering the global extent of peatlands and their carbon stock remains challenging. Referring to the UNEP's global peatland map, here we present PEATGRIDS, a data product containing global maps of peat thickness and carbon stock created created using the digital soil mapping approach. We compiled over 25,000 observations of peatland thickness, bulk density (BD) and carbon content (CC), globally. Using the Random Forest (RF) algorithm, we estimated peat thickness and peat BD and CC at {\textasciitilde}1 km resolution at multiple depths (0\&ndash;2 m) globally. The estimates were generated using 19 land surface covariates from digital maps and remote sensing images of land use, soil characteristics, topographical features, and climate parameters. The RF models for peat thickness were trained on 25,200 points grouped into six geographic regions. Validation of the peat thickness estimates showed a good performance, with the coefficient of determination (R\textsuperscript{2})\textsuperscript{ }ranging from 0.15 to 0.72. The prediction for peat BD and CC followed the same model architecture and were trained on 17,000 and 7,000 points, respectively. Overall, BD and CC models performed well and consistently across soil layers with average R\textsuperscript{2} values of 0.61 for BD and 0.48 for CC. Based on the estimated peat thickness, BD and CC, the carbon stock of global peatland was estimated to be 1,029 Pg C for peat dominated area of 6.57 million km\textsuperscript{2}.

The RMSE is of special interest because it is widely reported in the climatic and environmental literature; nevertheless, it is an inappropriate and misinterpreted measure of average error. RMSE is inappropriate because it is a function of 3 characteristics of a set of errors, rather than of one (the average error). RMSE varies with the variability within the distribution of error magnitudes and with the square root of the number of errors (n1/2), as well as with the average-error magnitude (MAE). Our findings indicate that MAE is a more natural measure of average error, and (unlike RMSE) is unambiguous. Dimensioned evaluations and inter-comparisons of average model-performance error, therefore, should be based on MAE.},

The whole radar system weighs 1.5\,kg and consists of a handheld vector network analyzer (VNA) working as frequency domain radar, a lightweight hybrid horn-dipole antenna covering a wide frequency range (250--2800\,MHz), a GPS for positioning, a microcomputer with the controlling application, and a smartphone for remote control. Soil moisture is derived from the radar data using full-wave inverse modeling based on the radar equation of Lambot et~al. and multilayered media Green's functions. The inversion is performed in the time domain and focuses on the surface reflection. The antenna-drone system is characterized by global reflection and transmission functions which are determined through a calibration procedure. We performed drone-GPR measurements over three different agricultural fields in the loess belt region of Belgium. In this study, we used the 500--700\,MHz range to avoid soil surface roughness effects and to focus on the top 10--20\,cm of the soil. These fields present a range of landform conditions leading to specific soil moisture distributions. The soil moisture maps were constructed from the local measurements using kriging. The obtained soil moisture maps are in good agreement with the topographical conditions of the fields and aerial orthophotography observations. These results demonstrated the potential and benefits of drone-GPR for fast, high-resolution mapping of soil moisture at the field scale, and to support, e.g., precision agriculture and environmental monitoring.},

Although considered sensitive to climate change and anthropogenic pressures, the spatial extent of peatlands is poorly constrained. We report the development of an improved global peatland map, PEATMAP, based on a meta-analysis of geospatial information collated from a variety of sources at global, regional and national levels. We estimate total global peatland area to be 4.23millionkm2, approximately 2.84\% of the world land area. Our results suggest that previous global peatland inventories are likely to underestimate peat extent in the tropics, and to overestimate it in parts of mid- and high-latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. Global wetland and soil datasets are poorly suited to estimating peatland distribution. For instance, tropical peatland extents are overestimated by Global Lakes and Wetlands Database -- Level 3 (GLWD-3) due to the lack of ground-truthing data; and underestimated by the use of histosols to represent peatlands in the Harmonized World Soil Database (HWSD) v1.2, as large areas of swamp forest peat in the humid tropics are omitted. PEATMAP and its underlying data are freely available as a potentially useful tool for scientists and policy makers with interests in peatlands or wetlands. PEATMAP's data format and file structure are intended to allow it to be readily updated when previously undocumented peatlands are found and mapped, and when regional or national land cover maps are updated and refined.},

  abstract = {Sampling design plays an important role in soil survey and soil mapping. Conditioned Latin hypercube sampling (cLHS) has been proven as an efficient sampling strategy and used widely in digital soil mapping. cLHS samples are randomly selected in each stratum of environmental variables, thus the produced sample sets can vary significantly at different runs with the same sample size. Although variation of mapping accuracies caused by the randomness of cLHS has been realized and qualitatively mentioned in past studies. However, how the randomness of cLHS could quantitatively influence mapping accuracy has rarely been examined. In this study, we conducted experiments to examine how the sample randomness quantitatively influence soil mapping accuracy with different sample sizes, and analyzed the possible reasons from a pedogenesis perspective. The results showed that the largest range of mapping accuracies of 500 repeats was 39.5\% at a sample density of 2.59~point/km2, while the smallest range was 7.3\% at the maximum sample size with a sample density of 32.47~point/km2. The sample density for satisfactory prediction accuracies in our study area was at least 10.06 ~Point/km2. The results showed that both the allocation of sample points to each soil series and the typicality of sample points played important roles in mapping accuracies. But the deep reasons causing the unstable performance of cLHS at small sample sizes were the imbalanced class distribution of soil series and the overlap between soil series in the distribution of environmental covariates. Researchers need to be cautious about the output when applying cLHS with small sampling densities. Some effective approaches to address this issue include increasing the sample size, checking the sample allocations of a cLHS design with the assistance of legacy soil maps, or adding the legacy soil map as a variable during sampling design. When the sampling resources and legacy soil maps are limited for an area, fuzzy k-means clustering sampling could be a potential alternative. This study provides useful references for better understanding the uncertainty of cLHS when the sample density is small and selecting alternative sampling methods accordingly.},

  abstract = {Specifying, assessing, and selecting among candidate statistical models is fundamental to ecological research. Commonly used approaches to model selection are based on predictive scores and include information criteria such as Akaike's information criterion, and cross validation. Based on data splitting, cross validation is particularly versatile because it can be used even when it is not possible to derive a likelihood (e.g., many forms of machine learning) or count parameters precisely (e.g., mixed-effects models). However, much of the literature on cross validation is technical and spread across statistical journals, making it difficult for ecological analysts to assess and choose among the wide range of options. Here we provide a comprehensive, accessible review that explains important---but often overlooked---technical aspects of cross validation for model selection, such as: bias correction, estimation uncertainty, choice of scores, and selection rules to mitigate overfitting. We synthesize the relevant statistical advances to make recommendations for the choice of cross-validation technique and we present two ecological case studies to illustrate their application. In most instances, we recommend using exact or approximate leave-one-out cross validation to minimize bias, or otherwise k-fold with bias correction if k {$<$} 10. To mitigate overfitting when using cross validation, we recommend calibrated selection via our recently introduced modified one-standard-error rule. We advocate for the use of predictive scores in model selection across a range of typical modeling goals, such as exploration, hypothesis testing, and prediction, provided that models are specified in accordance with the stated goal. We also emphasize, as others have done, that inference on parameter estimates is biased if preceded by model selection and instead requires a carefully specified single model or further technical adjustments.},

They are significant stocks of global soil carbon, and therefore predicting the depth of peatlands is an important part of establishing an accurate assessment of their magnitude. Yet there have been few attempts to account for both internal and external processes when predicting the depth of peatlands. Using blanket peatlands in Great Britain as a case study, we compare a linear and geostatistical (spatial) model and several sets of covariates applicable for peatlands around the world that have developed over hilly or undulating terrain. We hypothesized that the spatial model would act as a proxy for the autogenic processes in peatlands that can mediate the accumulation of peat on plateaus or shallow slopes. Our findings show that the spatial model performs better than the linear model in all cases---root mean square errors (RMSE) are lower, and 95\% prediction intervals are narrower. In support of our hypothesis, the spatial model also better predicts the deeper areas of peat, and we show that its predictive performance in areas of deep peat is dependent on depth observations being spatially autocorrelated. Where they are not, the spatial model performs only slightly better than the linear model. As a result, we recommend that practitioners carrying out depth surveys fully account for the variation of topographic features in prediction locations, and that sampling approach adopted enables observations to be spatially autocorrelated.},

Substantial progress in developing a DL methodology for a variety of earth science applications has been observed. Therefore, this review will concentrate on the use of the traditional NN and DL methods to advance the environmental remote sensing process. First, the potential of DL in environmental remote sensing, including land cover mapping, environmental parameter retrieval, data fusion and downscaling, and information reconstruction and prediction, will be analyzed. A typical network structure will then be introduced. Afterward, the applications of DL environmental monitoring in the atmosphere, vegetation, hydrology, air and land surface temperature, evapotranspiration, solar radiation, and ocean color are specifically reviewed.

  abstract = {The generalized linear geostatistical model (GLGM) is a formal approach of regression kriging that would be advantageous over commonly used modelling approaches for digital soil mapping (DSM). However, it has not been well explored in the literature, due to heavy computation. This study evaluates such formal approach for mapping soil organic matter at a regional scale (179,700~km2). We hypothesized that GLGM would be a better approach than other approaches as it can model nonlinear relationships and spatially consider the residuals. However, the accuracy would depend on sampling density. We compared GLGM with multiple linear regression (MLR), ordinary kriging (OK), regression kriging (RK), random forest (RF), generalized linear mixture model (GLMM), and generalized additive model (GAM). The effect of sampling density on the performance was also investigated by fitting the models based on resampling the samples with a series of sizes ranging from 100 to 1200. Results showed that GLGM generally improved the accuracy of DSM, compared with MLR, OK, RF, GLMM, and GAM, especially for large sample sizes, although the improvement was not significant. In a few cases, GLGM outperformed RK. The GLGM modelling and its prediction were largely influenced by sampling densities. Given small sample sizes, GLGM was unstable and the parameters were highly variable depending on the modelling realizations. Other influencing factors include linear and smooth correlations between soil and environmental covariates, spatial autocorrelation of the residuals, compatibility of spatial scales of soil samples and environmental covariates, and the scale of soil variation. For these factors, researchers with a more dense soil sampling are needed in future to explore the benefits of GLGM as a hybrid model for spatial prediction of soil.},

Unfortunately, such decision rules are hardly accessible to humans and cannot easily be used to gain insights about the application domain. Therefore, one often resorts to linear models in combination with variable selection, thereby sacrificing some predictive power for presumptive interpretability. Here, we introduce the Feature Importance Ranking Measure (FIRM), which by retrospective analysis of arbitrary learning machines allows to achieve both excellent predictive performance and superior interpretation. In contrast to standard raw feature weighting, FIRM takes the underlying correlation structure of the features into account. Thereby, it is able to discover the most relevant features, even if their appearance in the training data is entirely prevented by noise. The desirable properties of FIRM are investigated analytically and illustrated in simulations.},
