# Submission: Terrain is a stronger predictor of peat depth than airborne radiometrics in Norwegian landscapes

# Short summary

Peat depth is crucial to peatland management but often unknown. We used machine learning to map peat depth in two Norwegian landscapes, based on terrain and remotely sensed radiation. We found that terrain, especially elevation and valley bottom flatness, predicted peat depth better than radiation. Our approach improved existing maps but struggled to identify very deep peat, demonstrating that it can support regional planning but not replace field measurements for local carbon stock assessments.

Dear Editor,

Our manuscript presents novel contributions to digital soil mapping of peat depth:

- This study is the first to predict peat depth from airborne radiometric data using machine learning algorithms, providing a statistically rigorous assessment of their predictive value in contrasting Norwegian landscapes.

- We show that terrain variables, particularly elevation and Multi-Resolution Valley Bottom Flatness, are stronger predictors of peat depth than radiometric variables, which had inconsistent predictive power between sites.

- We provide practical guidance for regional peatland mapping by evaluating predictors and discussing methodologies â€” establishing a framework to inform larger-scale, government-supported mapping initiatives crucial for comprehensive peatland management and carbon accounting.
