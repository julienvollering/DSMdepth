  \section{For submission}
  "Appendices: all material required to understand the essential aspects of the paper
  such as experimental methods, data, and interpretation 
  should preferably be included in the main text. 
  Additional figures, tables, as well as technical and theoretical developments 
  which are not critical to support the conclusion of the paper,
  but which provide extra detail and/or support useful for experts in the field
  and whose inclusion in the main text would disrupt the flow of descriptions or demonstrations 
  may be presented as appendices.
  These should be labelled with capital letters: Appendix A, Appendix B etc.
  Equations, figures and tables should be numbered as (A1), Fig. B5 or Table C6, respectively.
  Please keep in mind that appendices are part of the manuscript
  whereas supplements (see below) are published along with the manuscript."
  
  \section{Figures and tables in appendices}
  Please also sort the appendix figures and appendix tables into the respective appendix sections.
  They will be correctly named automatically.
  
  \section{Copernicus from Rmarkdown}
  **Please note:** Per [their guidelines](https://publications.copernicus.org/for_authors/manuscript_preparation.html),
  Copernicus does not support additional \LaTeX{} packages 
  or new \LaTeX{} commands than those defined in their `.cls` file. 
  This means that you cannot add any extra dependencies 
  and a warning will be thrown if so.
  **Important**: Always double-check with the official manuscript preparation guidelines 
  at [https://publications.copernicus.org/for_authors/manuscript_preparation.html](https://publications.copernicus.org/for_authors/manuscript_preparation.html),
  especially the sections "Technical instructions for LaTeX" and "Manuscript composition". 
  Please contact Daniel Nüst, `daniel.nuest@uni-muenster.de`, with any problems.

# Results

Include a 12cm width figure of Nikolaus Copernicus from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Nikolaus_Kopernikus.jpg) with caption using R Markdown (Figure \@ref(fig:portrait)).

```{r portrait, out.width = "8.3cm", echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "one column figure"}
knitr::include_graphics("Nikolaus_Kopernikus.jpg")
```

## Tables

You can add \LaTeX table in an R Markdown document to meet the template requirements (Table \ref{tab:latextable}).


\begin{table}[t]
\caption{TEXT}
\begin{tabular}{l c r}
\tophline

a & b & c \\
\middlehline
1 & 2 & 3 \\

\bottomhline
\end{tabular}
\belowtable{Table Footnotes}
\label{tab:latextable}
\end{table}

Or you can use markdown to create the table with booktabs = FALSE (<https://github.com/rstudio/rticles/issues/558#issuecomment-1907981541>).

See Table \@ref(tab:test).

```{r test, echo=FALSE}
df = mtcars[1:3, 1:3]
knitr::kable(df, booktabs = FALSE, caption = "My caption")
```
